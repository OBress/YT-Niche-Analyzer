  "full_text": "I gripped the steering wheel tighter as I turned into the gravel parking lot of Meridian Manufacturing, the crunch of stones under my tires marking the end of eight months that had nearly broken me. Eight months of rejection emails, dwindling savings, and the constant gnawing fear that I'd end up on the street. The desperation had become a physical thing, sitting in my chest like a weight that made it hard to breathe some days. But today was different. Today, I had a job. I parked my beat-up Honda between a rusted pickup and a sedan that had seen better decades, then sat for a moment trying to calm my nerves. The factory building squatted ahead of me, and something about it made me pause. From the outside, it looked smaller than I'd expected for a manufacturing plant, maybe the size of a large warehouse, nothing more. But what really caught my attention were the windows. They were painted black, every single one of them, and the paint seemed to absorb the morning light rather than reflect it back. I'd never seen anything quite like it. \"Stop overthinking,\" I told myself. \"It's a job. That's all that matters.\" I grabbed my folder of paperwork from the passenger seat and headed for the main entrance. The glass doors were the only transparent surfaces on the entire building, and they led into a small reception area that felt more like a doctor's office than a factory. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead and the air smelled of industrial cleaner mixed with something I couldn't identify, something metallic and sharp. A thin man with prematurely gray hair emerged from a side door, checking his watch as he approached. He wore pressed khaki pants and a white button-down shirt that looked like it had been ironed that morning, along with a company ID badge clipped to his chest pocket. \"Marcus Thompson?\" he asked, extending his hand. \"I'm Christian Walker, your supervisor. Welcome to Meridian.\" \"Thank you,\" I said, shaking his hand. His grip was firm but cold, and his pale blue eyes studied me with an intensity that made me slightly uncomfortable. \"I'm grateful for the opportunity.\" \"Of course. Shall we begin the tour?\" Christian led me through a door marked \"Authorized Personnel Only\" and into a corridor that immediately confused me. The hallway stretched ahead of us much longer than should have been possible given the building's exterior dimensions. I found myself counting my steps. 20, 30, 40, and we were still walking. The walls were painted in institutional beige, and the same fluorescent lights that had hummed in the reception area continued overhead, casting everything in a harsh clinical glow. \"How is this building so deep?\" I thought, glancing back over my shoulder. The door we'd entered through seemed impossibly far away now, though we'd only been walking for a minute or two. Maybe there was an addition to the back of the building that I hadn't seen from the parking lot. That had to be it. \"Here's your employee handbook,\" Christian said, pulling a laminated card from his pocket and handing it to me as we walked. \"Please review the company policies carefully. They're quite important.\" I took the card and glanced down at it, expecting the usual workplace safety reminders and dress code requirements. Instead, I found myself reading rules that made no sense at all. \"Do not enter rooms marked with red tape. Avoid eye contact with employee 247. Report sightings of individuals not on the current shift roster. If you hear your name called from an empty room, do not respond. Reflective surfaces may show individuals who are not present. This is normal.\" I stopped walking and read the card again, certain I'd misunderstood something. But the text remained the same, bizarre, inexplicable rules that sounded more like instructions for surviving a horror movie than working in a manufacturing plant. \"Is this some kind of joke?\" I asked, looking up from the card. But Christian was gone. I spun around, checking both directions of the corridor. Empty. The hallway stretched in both directions with no sign of my supervisor, no sound of footsteps, no indication of where he might have disappeared to. He'd been right beside me just seconds ago, and now it was as if he'd simply vanished into thin air. My pulse quickened, and I felt that familiar tightness in my chest that came with anxiety. This was not normal. None of this was normal. But the weight of eight months without income pressed down on me, reminding me that I couldn't afford to be picky. I needed this job, whatever weirdness came with it. I studied the card again, memorizing the strange rules, then continued down the corridor in the direction we'd been heading. After what felt like another impossibly long stretch, I finally reached a set of double doors marked \"Production Floor, Line 7.\" The factory floor beyond was exactly what I'd expected. Concrete floors, metal shelving units, conveyor belts, and packaging stations. Workers in navy blue coveralls moved between the stations, though there seemed to be fewer people than I'd anticipated for a facility this size. The familiar sounds of industrial machinery provided a comforting backdrop after the unsettling silence of the corridors. I approached the nearest packaging station, where a woman with brown hair pulled back in a ponytail was sealing boxes with practiced efficiency. She wore safety glasses and had a small scar on her left hand that looked like it came from machinery. \"Excuse me,\" I said. \"I'm Marcus Thompson, the new hire. I'm looking for my workstation.\" She glanced up at me with hazel eyes that held no surprise, as if new employees appeared without supervisors all the time.\"You're at line seven. I'm Ember Mills.\" She gestured to the station next to hers. \"That's your spot there.\" \"Thanks. Do you know where Christian Walker went? He was giving me a tour and then just... disappeared.\" Ember's expression didn't change. She simply shrugged and returned to her work. \"He does that.\" The casual way she said it sent a chill down my spine. \"He does that.\" As if supervisors vanishing mid-conversation was perfectly normal behavior. I moved to the station she'd indicated and found another worker there, a man with black hair streaked with gray, wearing wire-rimmed glasses. He looked up from his packaging with dark brown eyes that seemed to assess me quickly before he spoke. \"Gary Calderon,\" he said in a precise, measured tone. \"You must be the new employee.\" \"Marcus Thompson,\" I replied. \"Nice to meet you.\" Gary nodded and returned to his work without further conversation. I stood there for a moment waiting for instructions or training or some indication of what I was supposed to be doing, but both of my new coworkers continued their tasks in near silence. The silence itself was strange. In every other workplace I'd been in, there had been conversation, banter, the normal social interaction that made long shifts bearable. Here, Ember and Gary worked with an almost mechanical efficiency, speaking only when absolutely necessary. But it wasn't just the lack of conversation that bothered me. The acoustics in the factory were wrong somehow. I could hear voices echoing from other parts of the floor, conversations that seemed to be happening in areas that looked empty from where I stood. When I turned to locate the sources of the voices, I saw only vacant workstations and motionless machinery. Above us, the fluorescent lights flickered constantly. Not the occasional flicker of aging bulbs, but a persistent rhythmic strobing that cast shifting shadows across the work floor. The shadows seemed to move independently of the people and equipment that should've been casting them, creating a disorienting effect that made me question what I was actually seeing. I tried to focus on the task at hand watching Ember's movements to understand what I'd be doing. The work itself seemed straightforward enough, taking items from the conveyor belt, placing them in boxes, sealing the boxes, and moving them to the outgoing pile. But the strange atmosphere of the place made it difficult to concentrate. After a few minutes of observation, I decided to try again with Ember. Maybe if I asked about something concrete, something work-related, she'd be more forthcoming. \"The lighting in here seems pretty inconsistent,\" I said, gesturing toward the flickering fluorescents overhead. \"Is there a maintenance issue or something?\" Ember glanced up at the lights, then back at me with the same neutral expression she'd worn since I'd arrived. She shrugged, a gesture that somehow managed to convey both acknowledgement and dismissal, then returned to her packaging without saying a word. The casual indifference in that shrug left me deeply unsettled. It wasn't just that she didn't want to talk about the lights. It was as if the question itself was meaningless, as if the constant flickering and the moving shadows and the voices from empty areas were all perfectly normal parts of working at Meridian Manufacturing. I stood there watching my new coworkers work in their strange silence, the laminated card of bizarre rules heavy in my pocket, and wondered what kind of place I had gotten myself into. My bladder had been demanding attention for the past hour, but I'd been too nervous about leaving my station to do anything about it. The constant mechanical rhythm of the conveyor belt and the oppressive silence from Ember and Gary made every minute feel stretched thin. Finally, around midnight, I couldn't ignore it anymore. I glanced over at Ember, who was methodically sealing another box without looking up. Gary remained focused on his own station, his wire-rimmed glasses reflecting the flickering fluorescent lights. Neither of them had spoken a word to me since our brief introductions hours ago. The whole shift felt like working alongside mannequins. \"I'll be right back,\" I said, more to fill the silence than because I expected a response. Ember didn't even acknowledge that I'd spoken. Gary's hands never paused in their precise movements. \"Right. Of course.\" I stepped away from my station and headed toward what I thought was the direction of the restrooms. Christian had mentioned them during his abbreviated tour before he'd mysteriously vanished, but I hadn't been paying close enough attention to the layout. The factory floor stretched out in multiple directions, with corridors branching off at irregular intervals. The fluorescent lights continued their maddening flicker, casting those impossible moving shadows that seemed to dance independently across the concrete floor. I picked a corridor that looked familiar, though honestly, they all look the same. Beige walls, industrial lighting, and that persistent smell of metal and chemical cleaner. My footsteps echoed more loudly than I expected in the empty hallway, each step seeming to bounce back at me from multiple directions. After walking for what felt like several minutes, I realized I was completely lost. This corridor was longer than any I remembered from the tour, and the walls seemed to stretch endlessly ahead. Worse, I hadn't seen a single door marked as a restroom. My bladder pressed more urgently against my patience, and I started to wonder if I should just turn around and ask Ember for directions, assuming she'd actually respond this time.That's when I noticed the red tape. It stretched across the floor in a perfect line, about three feet wide, running from one wall to the other. The tape looked fresh, industrial grade and completely out of place in the otherwise unremarkable hallway. My hand instinctively went to my pocket where the laminated rule card sat like a lead weight. Rule number one, avoid rooms marked with red tape on the floor. I stopped walking and stared at the tape. This wasn't a room marked with red tape. This was a corridor. Did the rule apply to hallways too? The distinction felt important, but also completely arbitrary. Why would they put red tape across a random hallway in the first place? What was beyond it that required such an obvious warning? I should have turned around. Every rational part of my brain screamed at me to respect the clearly marked boundary and head back to ask for proper directions. But eight months of unemployment had taught me that rational decisions didn't always pay the bills. And besides, I was just looking for a bathroom. How dangerous could that be? I stepped over the red tape. The hallway continued exactly as before. Same beige walls, same flickering lights, same chemical smell. Nothing changed. Nothing happened. I felt almost disappointed by how anti-climactic it was. Maybe the red tape was just some outdated safety marking that didn't mean anything anymore. Factories had all kinds of random safety protocols that accumulated over the years. I kept walking, telling myself I'd just find the restroom and head straight back. No harm done. The mechanical humming started about 20 feet past the red tape. It was low and rhythmic, like industrial machinery running on a continuous cycle. The sound seemed to come from behind one of the doors along the corridor, the first door I'd seen since crossing the tape. Unlike the other doors in the building, this one was partially open, maybe six inches, with a thin slice of brighter light spilling into the hallway. I slowed my pace and listened. The humming was definitely mechanical, not electrical like the fluorescent lights. It had a purposeful quality, like equipment designed for a specific task. Maybe it was just some kind of maintenance area or storage room for machinery, completely innocent. But my curiosity was stronger than my caution. After everything else I'd experienced tonight, Christian's disappearance, the bizarre rules, the unnatural silence from my coworkers, I needed to understand something about this place. I needed at least one answer to make sense of what I'd gotten myself into. I approached the partially open door and pressed my ear close to the gap. The humming was definitely coming from inside, steady and uninterrupted. There were no voices, no other sounds, just that continuous mechanical rhythm. It sounded like the kind of equipment that could run unsupervised for hours. Before I could talk myself out of it, I pushed the door wider. The smell hit me first, formaldehyde mixed with something else. Something organic and putrid that made my nose burn and my eyes water. It was the kind of smell that bypassed rational thought and went straight to the primitive part of my brain that recognized death and decay. Then I saw the tables. Three metal tables, the kind you'd see in a hospital or morgue, arranged in a neat row under harsh white lights. Each table was covered with dismembered body parts, arranged with clinical precision. Arms separated at the shoulders and elbows. Legs severed at the hips and knees. Torsos split open to reveal dark, empty cavities. And on the furthest table, a severed head with glassy eyes staring straight up at the ceiling. The mouth slightly open as if caught mid-sentence. The mechanical humming came from some kind of refrigeration unit along the back wall, keeping everything preserved and fresh. The sound that had seemed so innocent from the hallway now felt obscene, like a mechanical heartbeat in a room full of death. My brain struggled to process what I was seeing. This wasn't a factory for manufacturing anything legitimate. This was something else entirely, something that explained the painted over windows and the bizarre employee rules and the way Christian had vanished without explanation. The red tape wasn't marking a dangerous area. It was marking a crime scene. The smell overwhelmed my senses and my stomach lurched violently. I stumbled backward from the doorway, my hand flying to cover my mouth as bile rose in my throat. The room spun around me and I had to grab the door frame to keep from falling over. Every instinct screamed at me to get away from this place, to run as far and as fast as possible. I turned and ran. My footsteps echoed loudly in the empty corridor, each step sounding like a gunshot in the oppressive silence. I didn't care about stealth anymore, didn't care about following proper workplace protocol or maintaining the unnatural quiet that seemed to define this place. I just needed to get back to the main floor, back to something that resembled normal, back to people who weren't dismembered and stored on metal tables. Behind me, the door slammed shut with a metallic clang that reverberated through the entire building like a warning bell. The sound followed me as I ran, bouncing off the walls and multiplying until it felt like the whole factory was collapsing around me. I sprinted past the red tape without slowing down, past the endless beige walls and flickering lights, past everything that had seemed merely strange before, but now felt sinister and threatening.I burst back onto line seven, my chest heaving and my hands shaking from adrenaline. The familiar sight of the conveyor belts and packaging stations should have been comforting, but something was wrong. My workstation sat empty, exactly as I'd left it. But Ember and Gary were nowhere to be seen. Their stations were abandoned too. Ember's sealing equipment sat idle with half-finished boxes scattered around her area. Gary's packaging materials remained untouched as if he'd simply vanished mid-task. The conveyor belt continued its mechanical rhythm, carrying empty spaces where products should have been. But the people who'd been working alongside me for hours had completely disappeared. I stood there alone on the factory floor listening to the mindless mechanical rhythm of the belt, wondering if I was the only living person left in the building. I opened my mouth to call out again, but the words felt hollow before they even left my throat. \"Ember? Gary?\" My voice carried across the factory floor and seemed to just vanish. Not echo, not fade naturally. It disappeared into the vast space above like the building had swallowed it whole. The mechanical rhythm of the conveyor belt kept going. That same mindless sound I'd been listening to for hours, but now it felt like the only proof that anything in this place was still functioning normally. Where the hell had they gone? People didn't just evaporate from their workstations. Ember had been right there, sealing boxes with that methodical precision she'd maintained all evening. Gary had been organizing his packaging materials with the same careful attention to detail he'd shown since I'd started. Now their stations looked abandoned, like they'd been empty for hours instead of the few minutes I'd been gone, well, more than a few minutes. However long I'd spent wandering those corridors, finding that room, running back here, time felt warped in this place. But still, they'd been here when I left. I was sure of it. The fluorescent lights above continued their erratic flickering, casting those strange moving shadows that seem to operate independently of any actual objects. I'd gotten used to that particular weirdness over the course of the shift. But now standing alone on the factory floor, it felt more ominous than annoying. Every flicker made me think something was moving in my peripheral vision. I needed to find Christian. He was my supervisor, and supervisors were supposed to have answers. Though given his tendency to vanish without warning, I wasn't holding my breath for a reasonable explanation. Maybe this was normal here. Maybe workers just disappeared sometimes, and everyone pretended it was perfectly ordinary business procedure. Yeah, right. Just like dismembered bodies in refrigerated rooms was normal business procedure. \"Working late, Marcus?\" I spun around so fast I nearly lost my balance. Standing about 10 feet behind me was someone I recognized. Bodhi Graves, one of the guys I'd met briefly during orientation. Tall, dark hair. Friendly enough during our short conversation. He'd seemed normal then, one of the few people in this place who'd actually made eye contact and spoken in complete sentences. But something was different now. He was smiling at me, and that should have been reassuring. Instead, it made every muscle in my body tense up. \"Bodhi,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady, \"I was just looking for Ember and Gary. They were here a minute ago.\" His smile widened, and that's when I realized what was wrong with his expression. The grin stretched too far across his face, pulling his features in a way that looked painful. And his teeth, there were too many of them. Not just the normal compliment of human teeth, but rows of sharp, pointed things that seemed to go back farther into his mouth than they should, like a shark's mouth crammed into a human skull. My brain tried to rationalize what I was seeing. Bad lighting, weird angle, stress-induced hallucination brought on by finding a room full of body parts. But the longer I looked at him, the more obvious it became that this wasn't a trick of the light or my imagination running wild. \"Did you see something interesting tonight, Marcus?\" He asked, and his voice carried an odd quality I hadn't noticed during orientation, like there were harmonics underneath his words, multiple tones layered together in a way that made my skin crawl. The employee handbook card felt heavy in my pocket. I'd memorized those rules by now, and one of them was flashing in my mind like a neon sign. Report any coworkers who seem off or different from when you first met them. Different. Yeah, that was putting it mildly. I took a step backward, keeping my eyes fixed on that unnaturally broad smile. \"I was looking for Christian,\" I said. \"Do you know where he went?\" \"Gerald's busy right now,\" Bodhi said, tilting his head at an angle that seemed too extreme for a normal neck joint. \"But I'd be happy to help you with whatever you need.\" Gerald? I'd never heard that name before. Christian was my supervisor, not Gerald. But Bodhi was talking like he knew exactly who I meant, just using a different name. Either he was confused or I was missing something important about the people I'd been working with. He took a step closer, and I noticed his movements were wrong too.... too fluid, too graceful. People didn't walk like that, with perfect balance and coordination that made every motion look choreographed. It reminded me of how big cats moved, that predatory grace that made you understand you were looking at something designed to hunt. \"That's okay,\" I said, taking another step back. \"I'll find him myself.\" Another step backward, then another. Bodhi's eyes reflected the fluorescent light as he watched me retreat, catching the glare like an animal's eyes in headlights. The effect was subtle, but unmistakable, a brief flash of light that human eyes didn't produce. I'd been desperate enough for this job to overlook a lot of weird things, the painted windows, the bizarre rules, the unnatural silence of my coworkers. I'd even managed to rationalize the room full of body parts as something I could report to the police after I'd gotten safely out of the building. But this, whatever Bodhi had become or whatever was wearing his appearance, this was beyond my ability to rationalize or ignore. My back hit something solid, and I realized I'd reached the emergency exit. The metal door felt cold against my shoulder blades, and I could feel the push bar pressing into my back. Just a quick shove backward, and I'd be outside, away from Bodhi's too-wide grin and reflective eyes. \"You seem nervous, Marcus,\" he said, his voice carrying even more of those strange harmonics. \"Is there something wrong?\" I reached behind me with one hand, feeling for the push bar while keeping my eyes locked on his face. The last thing I wanted to do was look away from him, not when he was watching me with that predatory intensity. \"Just tired,\" I said. \"Long first day.\" \"Oh, I think your day is just getting started.\" That's when he lunged forward with inhuman speed, covering the distance between us faster than anything human size should be able to move. I caught a glimpse of those too-numerous teeth and eyes that reflected light like mirrors before I threw myself backward against the emergency exit. The push bar gave way under my weight, and I slammed the door shut behind me just as something heavy crashed into it from the other side. My fingers shook as I fought with the lock mechanism, the metal cold and unfamiliar under my touch. Each impact from the other side sent vibrations through the door frame and into my bones. The crashes weren't just loud. They carried a weight that felt impossible, like someone was throwing a sledgehammer against the barrier instead of using fists. The metal actually bent. I watched the door bow inward with each strike, the reinforced steel warping like it was nothing more than aluminum foil. Whatever was hitting it possessed strength that defied every law of physics I understood. No human being could generate that kind of force, not even someone built like a linebacker. Through the warped metal, I heard what should've been David's voice, but the sounds coming through weren't words anymore. They were clicks and chittering noises, like insects communicating in some alien language. The rhythm suggested speech patterns, but the actual sounds made my skin crawl. Whatever had been wearing David's face was dropping its pretense now that I'd escaped. Then everything went silent. I pressed my back against the stairwell wall. Every muscle in my body coiled tight. My breathing sounded deafening in the sudden quiet. Harsh, ragged gasps that echoed off the concrete walls. I tried to control it, but my lungs demanded oxygen after the surge of pure terror that had carried me through that door. Minutes crawled by. I counted my heartbeats, listening for any sound from the other side. Nothing. No footsteps, no more clicking, no indication that anything was still waiting out there. But I didn't trust the silence. After everything I'd witnessed tonight, quiet felt more dangerous than noise. The employee handbook rules made perfect sense now. They weren't quirky workplace policies or some elaborate hazing ritual. They were survival instructions for a place where reality had different rules, where things could wear human faces and hunt in the corridors. I'd thought I was desperate enough to endure anything for a paycheck, but this went beyond desperation into pure madness. Footsteps approached from the factory floor, multiple sets moving with normal human cadence. I tensed against the wall, ready to bolt up the stairs if whatever was out there had brought reinforcements. \"Marcus?\" Christian's voice calm and measured just like during the tour, but I'd learned not to trust familiar voices in this place. \"It's safe to come out.\" Safe? The word felt like a cruel joke after what I'd just experienced. Nothing about this place was safe. But staying trapped in this stairwell wouldn't solve anything either, and I needed answers about what had just tried to kill me. I reached for the lock mechanism again, my hand still trembling. The metal felt warm now from the impacts it had absorbed. Slowly, carefully, I disengaged the lock and cracked the door open just enough to peer through. Gerald stood about 10 feet away, and I realized with a start that this was the first time I'd seen him since he'd vanished in the corridor hours ago. His pressed khakis and white shirt looked exactly the same, not a wrinkle out of place despite whatever had happened. Ember stood beside him in her navy coveralls, the same resigned expression on her face that she'd worn while sealing boxes. Gary was there too, his wire-rimmed glasses catching the fluorescent light, along with several other workers I recognized from the shift.All of them looked completely normal, human. Their eyes didn't reflect light, their smiles contained the appropriate number of teeth, and they moved with natural human rhythms. But David was nowhere to be seen. I opened the door wider, stepping cautiously back onto the factory floor. The area where David had been standing was empty. No sign of the struggle or the creature that had been wearing his face. Even the scuff marks from my hasty retreat to the door had been erased. \"We heard the commotion,\" Gerald said, his tone carrying the same professional calm he'd used during the tour, like finding an employee barricaded behind an emergency exit was just another routine workplace incident. \"David's been taken care of. He wasn't supposed to be here tonight.\" Taken care of? The phrase sent ice through my veins. I thought about the room with the metal tables, the clinical arrangement of body parts under harsh lights. Was that where things got taken care of when they weren't supposed to be somewhere? \"I met David during orientation,\" I said, testing their reaction. If they were going to lie to me, I wanted to see how they'd do it. Ember shook her head, speaking for the first time since I'd returned to the floor. \"You met something using David's appearance. The real Bodhi Graves quit last month.\" Bodhi Graves. That was the name I'd heard during orientation, not David. But the face had been identical down to the last detail. The thing had somehow copied not just Bodhi's appearance, but his mannerisms, his voice, even his casual way of speaking, until it had revealed its true nature with those rows of teeth and predatory grace. Gary nodded, adjusting his glasses with the same precise movement I'd observed at his workstation. \"It happens sometimes. That's why we have the rules.\" The rules? The bizarre employee handbook that I'd thought was some kind of elaborate joke now revealed itself as a survival manual. Every strange directive suddenly made perfect sense in the context of a workplace where shape-shifting creatures could impersonate employees and hunt in the corridors. I pulled the laminated card from my pocket, looking at it with new understanding. Rule number three. Report any coworker who seems off or different from when you first met them. I'd noticed the changes in Bodhi, David, whatever it was. The unnatural smile, the reflected eyes, the fluid movements that were too graceful for human anatomy. But I'd rationalized them away, told myself I was imagining things because of the stress and the strange environment. My desperation for this job had nearly gotten me killed. I'd ignored every warning sign, every instinct screaming that something was wrong, because I needed the paycheck more than I needed to trust my own judgment. Eight months of unemployment had made me willing to accept the unacceptable. \"How long has this been going on?\" I asked, looking between Gerald and the others. They stood in a loose semicircle around me, their faces showing the same resigned acceptance I'd seen from Ember earlier, like this was just another aspect of working at Meridian Manufacturing, as routine as clocking in or taking lunch breaks. \"Long enough that we know how to handle it,\" Gerald replied. He straightened his company ID badge, the small gesture somehow making the conversation feel even more surreal. We were discussing shape-shifting predators like they were a minor workplace hazard, something to be managed rather than feared. I thought about Ember and Gary's earlier disappearance, how they'd vanished from their workstations while I was exploring the red-taped corridor. Had they been hiding from the thing wearing Bodhi's face? Did they have some kind of warning system, a way to know when the factory's normal dangers escalated into something worse? \"The real Bodhi Graves,\" I said, testing the name. \"What happened to him?\" \"Smart enough to quit after his first week,\" one of the other workers said. \"I recognized him from the orientation group but couldn't remember his name. Saw what this place was really about and decided his safety was worth more than the paycheck.\" That should've been my choice too. I should've walked away the moment Gerald handed me that rule card, or when he disappeared in the corridor, or when I discovered the room with the metal tables. Instead, I'd stayed because I needed the money, because I was tired of being unemployed, because I thought I could handle whatever weirdness came with the job. Now I knew better. This wasn't just weirdness. It was something far more dangerous, something that could kill me if I made the wrong choice or ignored the wrong warning sign. The thing wearing Bodhi's face had been toying with me, enjoying the hunt before moving in for whatever it had planned. \"So, what happens now?\" I asked. The question felt loaded with implications I wasn't sure I wanted to understand. Did I go back to my workstation and pretend none of this had happened? Did I follow Bodhi's example and quit while I still could? Or was I already too deep in whatever this place really was to simply walk away? Robert nodded and explained that it happened sometimes, which was why they had the rules. I stared at Christian and the others, waiting for someone to crack a smile or break character. Someone had to admit this was all some twisted orientation hazing ritual. The silence stretched between us while I searched their faces for any hint of humanity, any sign that we were all in on the same joke. Nothing,Their expressions remained flat and matter-of-fact, like we'd just discussed the weather instead of a co-worker who'd transformed into something with rows of shark teeth. Ember's hazel eyes held that same resigned look she'd worn all night, as if supernatural workplace incidents were just another item on her daily checklist. Gary adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses with mechanical precision, maintaining that careful distance he'd established from the moment I'd met him. The absurdity of it all crashed over me. These people were acting like shape-shifting monsters were a normal Tuesday night occurrence, like finding dismembered bodies was just another workplace hazard to manage alongside proper lifting techniques and fire safety protocols. \"What about the room?\" I demanded, my voice coming out sharper than intended. \"The room with the body parts?\" Christian's eyebrows raised slightly, and he tilted his head with practiced concern. \"What room?\" His eyes told a different story. They held the calculating look of someone who knew exactly what I meant but was deciding how much to admit, the same look he'd worn right before vanishing in the corridor earlier, leaving me to navigate this nightmare alone. \"The room marked with red tape,\" I said, pulling the words out through gritted teeth, \"full of dismembered corpses on metal tables, the room that smelled like formaldehyde and rotting meat. The room that made me understand why you paint all your windows black.\" The other workers exchanged glances that lasted exactly two seconds, perfectly timed, perfectly coordinated, like they'd rehearsed this conversation a dozen times before with other new hires who'd made the same mistake I had. Christian smoothed his white shirt and straightened his company ID badge with deliberate movements. \"Marcus, you must've been mistaken. The stress of a new job can cause hallucinations sometimes. First-day nerves, you know.\" The words came out measured and reasonable, delivered with the same professional tone he'd used during the tour. But there was something underneath it now, a careful precision that reminded me of reading from a script, every syllable calculated to sound concerned while revealing nothing. \"Hallucinations,\" I repeated, tasting the word like it was something rotten. The other workers nodded in perfect synchronization, too perfect. Their heads moved at exactly the same angle, at exactly the same speed, like marionettes controlled by the same puppet master. But none of them would look directly at me. Their eyes focused on points just over my shoulder or slightly to my left, as if making actual eye contact might break whatever spell they were trying to cast. Gary cleared his throat with mechanical precision. \"New employees often experience disorientation during their first shift. The layout can be confusing.\" Ember's voice joined in with that flat Midwestern accent. \"Factory work takes getting used to,\" another worker I barely remembered from orientation chimed in. \"First nights are always rough.\" Each response came exactly three seconds after the previous one. I counted the intervals without meaning to, my brain latching onto the pattern because it was the only thing that made sense in this conversation. Everything else was madness dressed up as corporate concern. I looked around the group again, really studying their faces this time. The fluorescent lights continued their erratic flickering, casting moving shadows that made their expressions shift and change. But underneath the constantly shifting illumination, I caught something else, a tightness around their eyes that suggested they were working very hard to maintain these neutral expressions, like they were all holding their breath waiting for me to accept their explanation and move on. But I'd seen what I'd seen, the metallic tables, the separated limbs arranged with clinical precision, the severed head with those glassy eyes staring at nothing, the smell that had burned my nose and made my stomach lurch. No amount of first-day stress could manufacture details that specific, that visceral. \"This is insane,\" I said, the words coming out as barely more than a whisper. Christian nodded with that same practiced concern, like a therapist acknowledging a patient's delusion. \"Your shift ends in 20 minutes anyway, Marcus. Why don't you head home, get some rest? We'll see you tomorrow night.\" Tomorrow night, like I was supposed to come back, like I was supposed to pretend this conversation had convinced me that everything I'd experienced was just stress-induced imagination, like I was supposed to clock in again and take my place next to Ember and Gary and go back to packaging whatever it was we were supposed to be packaging. The casual assumption in his voice made my skin crawl. He wasn't asking if I'd return. He was telling me I would with the same certainty he'd used to explain the employee handbook rules, another inevitable part of the process. My hands started shaking before I made the conscious decision to leave. The tremor started in my fingers and spread up through my wrists, making the laminated rule card rustle in my pocket. I needed to get out of this building, away from these people who spoke in synchronized responses and treated horror like paperwork. \"I need to leave,\" I managed to say. Christian's smile never wavered. \"Of course. Have a good night, Marcus.\" I turned toward the emergency exit I'd used to escape from the thing wearing Bodhi's face. My legs felt unsteady, like I was walking on a ship's deck in rough weather.... each step required conscious effort, conscious balance. The factory floor stretched around me, filled with the mechanical rhythm of conveyor belts and the constant flicker of overhead lights. Behind me, I heard the soft shuffle of feet as the group dispersed. No conversation. No discussion of what had just happened. Just the quiet sound of people returning to their work stations like we'd finished a routine safety meeting. The emergency exit door opened easily under my palm. No resistance. No struggle with the mechanism like before. The night air hit my face with shocking coolness, carrying the scent of distant rain and normal things like asphalt and car exhaust. Real smells from a real world that operated according to rules I understood. My Honda sat exactly where I'd left it, wedged between the rusted pickup and the old sedan. The gravel crunched under my work boots as I walked across the parking lot. Each step taking me further from the building that looked so innocuous from the outside. Just another small manufacturing facility with painted windows and a modest sign. I fumbled with my keys, my shaking hands making it difficult to find the right one. The metal felt cold and solid between my fingers, a tangible reminder of ordinary reality. Things that worked the way they were supposed to work, doors that opened when you turned the key, cars that started when you turned the ignition. The factory building sat behind me in my peripheral vision, giving no hint of the labyrinthine interior I'd just escaped. I turned the key, and the Honda's engine coughed to life, that familiar grinding sound that meant I'd be looking at another repair bill soon. The dashboard clock read 2:47 in the morning. My hands had stopped shaking mostly, though I could still feel the adrenaline working its way out of my system like a slow-acting poison. The factory disappeared in my rearview mirror as I pulled onto the main road. Just another building now, unremarkable in the darkness. No hint of what went on inside those painted windows. No suggestion that people or things that looked like people wandered those corridors doing God knows what. I tried to focus on the drive home. Empty streets, traffic lights cycling through their colors for no one. The radio played some late-night talk show host discussing conspiracy theories, which felt uncomfortably appropriate. I turned it off and drove in silence, letting my mind work through what had happened. The rational part of my brain kept trying to take control. First-day jitters, stress from months of unemployment. Maybe the factory used some kind of chemical that caused hallucinations. Maybe it really was an elaborate hazing ritual that got out of hand. Companies did weird things to test new employees, right? Some kind of psychological evaluation disguised as a normal shift, but that didn't explain the room. The smell of formaldehyde mixed with decay. The way those body parts had been arranged so clinically, like specimens in a lab. The mechanical humming from the refrigeration unit. You couldn't fake that smell. You couldn't fake the way my stomach had lurched when I saw that severed head staring at nothing. And you definitely couldn't fake the way Bodhi had moved, too fluid, too graceful. The multiple rows of teeth, eyes that reflected light like an animal's. I pulled into my apartment complex and sat in the parking space for a moment. The building looked exactly the same as when I'd left it eight hours ago. Same cracked sidewalk, same broken security light that the landlord kept promising to fix. Same normalcy that felt foreign now, like I was seeing it through different eyes. My phone buzzed against my leg. I pulled it out, expecting a text from my sister asking how the new job went or maybe a spam message about extending my car warranty. Unknown number. The message was short. \"Welcome to Meridian Manufacturing. Tomorrow's shift begins at 6:00 PM. Don't be late.\" I stared at the screen until it went dark, then turned it back on to read the message again. Same words, same unknown number. No way to reply, the message showed up as a notification, not a conversation thread. They expected me back. I climbed the stairs to my apartment, each step feeling heavier than the last. Inside, everything was exactly as I'd left it. Dishes in the sink. Yesterday's clothes on the bedroom floor. The stack of bills on the kitchen counter that I'd been avoiding for weeks. I dropped onto the couch and tried to think through my options. I could quit, walk away, find another job somewhere else. The unemployment notices could wait another few weeks, maybe a month if I was careful with what little money I had left. But even as I thought it, I knew it wasn't realistic. Eight months of searching had led me to Meridian Manufacturing. Eight months of rejection letters and automated responses and interviews that went nowhere. My savings were gone. Credit cards maxed out. Rent due in two weeks. I pulled out the laminated rule card and read through it again by the light from my phone. Each rule made more sense now. Avoid rooms marked with red tape because they contained evidence of whatever the factory really did. Don't make eye contact with employee 247 because some employees weren't employees at all. Report coworkers who seemed different because things could take their place. Maybe the real Bodie Graves had been smart, recognized the danger and got out before it was too late. But he probably had savings. Probably had family he could borrow from. Probably had options I didn't have.I set the card on the coffee table and tried to sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that severed head, the glassy eyes, the mouth hanging slightly open. The clinical way everything had been arranged like someone was studying human anatomy. When I finally did sleep, I dreamed about corridors that went on forever and voices calling my name from empty rooms. I woke up around noon with sunlight filtering through my blinds and the taste of formaldehyde still in my mouth. The bills were still on the kitchen counter, the bank account was still nearly empty, the unemployment notices were still piling up like accusations. I made coffee and sat at the kitchen table staring at those notices. Benefit period ending soon. No job prospects, no savings left. The math was simple and brutal. By evening, I was back in the Honda driving toward Meridian Manufacturing. I told myself I'd be more careful this time. Follow the rules exactly. Stay on line seven. Don't explore, don't ask questions. Just do the work and collect the paycheck. The parking lot looked different somehow, smaller. The rusted pickup was still there along with the old sedan, but Bodhi's car was gone. The space where it had been parked was empty, just gravel and oil stains. I sat in the car for a moment, engine running, telling myself I could still leave. Drive away and figure out something else. But the gas gauge was sitting just above empty and I had maybe $20 in my wallet. The factory's main entrance opened and Christian walked out. Same pressed khakis, same white button-down shirt, same company ID badge hanging from his neck. He approached my car with that measured smile, the one that never quite reached his eyes. I rolled down the window. \"Ready for another night?\" I nodded, my hand finding the laminated rule card in my pocket. I'd memorized every instruction during the long afternoon. This time, I'd follow them exactly. I stepped out of my Honda and followed Christian through the glass doors, my fingers already checking for the rule card in my pocket. The reception area looked exactly the same. Fluorescent lights humming overhead, that mix of industrial cleaner and something metallic hanging in the air. Christian led me through the authorized personnel only door without a word, and this time, I paid attention to every turn, every corridor junction, every detail that might help me navigate this place on my own. The beige walls stretched endlessly under the flickering lights, but I didn't let myself count steps or wonder about the impossible distances anymore. That kind of thinking belonged to my first night when I still believed this place had to make sense. Now, I understood that survival meant accepting what couldn't be explained and focusing on what I could control. When we reached the double doors marked Production Floor, Line 7, Christian gestured me through with that same measured smile. He didn't disappear this time. Maybe he only pulled that vanishing act with truly new employees, the ones who hadn't proven they could handle what this place really was. Ember stood at her packaging station, brown hair pulled back in the same ponytail. Safety glasses reflecting the overhead lights. She glanced up when I approached, gave me a small nod, then returned to sealing boxes. No conversation needed. Gary was already at his station, wire-rimmed glasses catching the light as he worked with the same methodical precision I remembered. He acknowledged me with a brief look, nothing more. I took my position at the adjacent station and picked up where I'd left off the night before. The work itself was simple enough, checking packages, applying labels, moving boxes down the line. My hands found the rhythm quickly, muscle memory from a single shift somehow intact. The important thing was keeping busy, staying focused on the task, not letting my attention wander to the sounds that echoed from empty sections of the factory floor. Because there were sounds. Voices calling from areas where no one worked. Footsteps that didn't match any visible movement. The same mechanical humming I'd heard behind that door marked with red tape. Though now I knew better than to investigate, I kept my eyes on my work and let the sounds fade in the background noise. Just another part of the job. The fluorescent lights flickered in their irregular patterns, casting shadows that moved independently of their sources. I'd learned not to track those movements, not to try making sense of shadows that bent wrong or stretched too far. My peripheral vision caught things that shouldn't be there, but I trained myself to look straight ahead, focus on the packages, ignore anything that didn't directly relate to the work. Around 10:30, a new employee appeared on the floor. Young guy, maybe 22, with nervous energy and wide eyes that took in everything. He kept looking around, asking questions, trying to understand what he was seeing. I recognize that expression, the same confusion and growing unease I'd felt on my first night. Christian appeared beside him, explaining something in low tones. The new guy nodded, but I could see he wasn't really listening. His attention kept drifting to the empty areas where voices echoed, to the shadows that moved wrong, to the workers who stood too still at their stations. By 11:15, I noticed something off about the new employee. His movements had become too fluid, too graceful. When he turned his head, it rotated further than human anatomy should allow.His smile stretched wider than it had when he first arrived, revealing teeth that seemed sharper, more numerous. I didn't stare. I didn't try to confirm what I was seeing. Instead, I reached into my pocket and touched the laminated rule card, reminding myself of rule three. Report any coworker who seems different from when you first met them. I caught Christian's attention with a subtle gesture and nodded toward the new employee. Christian followed my gaze, observed for exactly three seconds, then approached the transformed worker. Their conversation was brief, conducted in voices too low for me to hear. The thing wearing the new employee's appearance followed Christian toward the emergency exit I'd used on my first night. Neither of them returned to the floor. I went back to my packaging work. Ember and Gary continued their tasks without pause, as if nothing unusual had happened, because in this place, nothing unusual had happened. This was just Tuesday night at Meridian Manufacturing. The weeks fell into a pattern after that. I arrived at 6:00, worked my shift, collected my paycheck, and went home. I learned to navigate the maze of corridors by following the same route every time, memorizing each turn until I could walk to line seven without conscious thought. I discovered which areas to avoid beyond just the red-taped sections, certain corridors where the air felt thicker, doorways that seemed to lead nowhere, sections where the fluorescent lights flickered in patterns that hurt to watch. Other new employees came and went. Some lasted a few nights before quitting, smart enough to recognize the danger and prioritize their safety over the money. Others stayed longer, but made critical mistakes, investigating sounds they should have ignored, making eye contact with things that looked like coworkers but moved wrong, entering areas marked with warning tape. Those employees simply stopped showing up. Their work stations would sit empty for a night or two, then new people would appear to fill them. Christian never offered explanations, and I never asked. The rule card had taught me that survival meant accepting what I couldn't control and focusing on what I could. I became good at spotting the signs when something had taken an employee's place. The too-wide smiles, the eyes that reflected light like an animal's, the movements that were either too fluid or too rigid for human physiology. I learned to report these incidents quickly and quietly, then return to my work while Christian handled the situation. My bank account slowly recovered. Rent got paid on time. I bought groceries without checking prices. The financial pressure that had driven me to accept this job in the first place gradually eased, but I didn't quit. This place had taught me something valuable about survival, about adapting to circumstances that couldn't be changed or reasoned with. I learned to coexist with the impossible. When voices called my name from empty corridors, I ignored them. When shadows moved independently of their sources, I focused on my packaging work. When the mechanical humming grew louder from behind doors marked with red tape, I reminded myself that some knowledge carried too high a price. The factory operated according to rules that had nothing to do with normal reality, but it did have rules, consistent ones, predictable ones. As long as I followed them exactly, as long as I accepted rather than questioned, as long as I treated the supernatural as routine workplace hazards to be managed rather than mysteries to be solved, I could survive here. Ember and Gary became familiar presences, coworkers who understood the unspoken agreement that kept us all safe. We worked in comfortable silence, acknowledged each other's presence without unnecessary conversation, and maintained the professional distance that this job required. They'd been here longer than me, had learned the same lessons about survival through acceptance. Christian remained a constant, appearing when needed, handling situations that required his intervention, then fading back into whatever administrative duties occupied his time. His pressed khakis and white button-down shirt never wrinkled. His company ID badge always hung at precisely the same angle, and his measured smile never varied. I stopped trying to understand what Meridian Manufacturing actually produced, or why it operated the way it did. Those questions belonged to my first night, when I still believed everything had to have logical explanations. Now I understood that some places existed outside normal logic, and trying to impose rational frameworks on them was both pointless and dangerous. The important thing was that I had steady work, reliable income, and a clear set of rules that kept me safe as long as I followed them without deviation. I'd found a way to make this arrangement work, to navigate the impossible corridors and coexist with whatever inhabited this place after dark. Some nights were quieter than others. Some brought more new employees who had to learn the same hard lessons about survival and acceptance. But I'd established my place here, proven I could handle what this job required, demonstrated that I understood the real nature of the work. I'd learned to survive in a place where the normal rules of reality didn't apply. The steady rhythm of packaging work had become second nature to me by now. Three months of nights at Meridian Manufacturing, and my hands moved without conscious thought. Seal, stack, move to the next box.The fluorescent lights flickered overhead in their familiar erratic pattern, casting those impossible shadows that seemed to dance independently of their sources. I'd learned not to watch them too closely. Ember worked at her station to my left, brown hair pulled back in that same ponytail, safety glasses reflecting the harsh factory lighting. She'd given me a brief nod when I arrived tonight, the same acknowledgement she'd offered every shift for weeks now. Gary stood at his packaging area, wire-rimmed glasses catching the light as he maintained his methodical pace. We'd developed an unspoken understanding over these months. Three people who knew how to survive in a place that defied every rational explanation. The voices echoed from empty corners of the factory floor, calling names that weren't ours. I'd stopped trying to identify the sources weeks ago. Sometimes footsteps would click across the concrete with no visible person attached to them. The mechanical humming from beyond the red-taped areas provided a constant background drone that I'd trained myself to filter out completely. These sounds had become as routine as the packaging work itself. My paycheck sat folded in my back pocket, the same reliable amount that had pulled me out of financial desperation. Rent paid on time for three consecutive months. Groceries purchased without calculating every dollar. Credit card payments that actually reduced the balance instead of just covering interest. The eight months of unemployment felt like a different lifetime now, back when I thought normal jobs were the only option available. Christian appeared at the edge of my vision, making his rounds with that measured smile and pressed khakis that never seemed to wrinkle. His company ID badge hung at the exact same angle it had on my first night, catching the light identically. He nodded in my direction before continuing his patrol of the factory floor. I understood now that Christian or Gerald, depending on which name applied, wasn't just a supervisor. He was something closer to a guardian, protecting those of us who'd learned the rules while allowing the factory's darker forces to claim workers who couldn't adapt. A new employee had started two weeks ago, a woman in her thirties who'd asked too many questions and investigated sounds she should've ignored. By the end of her first week, her movements had become unnaturally fluid, her smile stretching too wide to reveal teeth that multiplied in rows. I'd signaled Christian immediately, touching the laminated rule card in my pocket. He'd handled the situation with his usual efficiency, and by the next night, her workstation stood empty. Another replacement would arrive soon enough. They always did. The factory operated according to laws that had nothing to do with physics or human logic, but those laws were consistent, predictable even. Follow the rules exactly. Accept what couldn't be explained. Treat the supernatural elements as workplace hazards rather than mysteries demanding solutions. The building might stretch into impossible dimensions. Creatures might wear the faces of former employees, and rooms behind red tape might contain horrors that burn themselves into memory, but survival was achievable through strict compliance and willful ignorance. I'd memorized every safe route through the corridors, learned which areas produced that thick, oppressive air that made breathing difficult, identified the doorways that led to spaces that shouldn't exist. The red tape marked obvious boundaries, but subtler warnings existed throughout the facility. Light fixtures that flickered in patterns that hurt to watch directly. Corners where shadows gathered too densely. Sections of wall that felt wrong to touch, even through clothing. My muscle memory had adapted to the packaging work completely. Box after box moved through my station while my mind processed the ambient strangeness without being overwhelmed by it. Ember had reached the same level of adaptation months before I arrived. Gary had been here even longer, developing that precise technical approach to survival that treated each supernatural encounter like a documented workplace safety protocol. The clock on the factory wall showed 5:58 AM, two minutes until shift change. My hands completed the final packaging sequence as other workers began the subtle movements that indicated preparation for departure. No one announced the end of shift or gathered personal belongings. We'd all learned to travel light in this place. Christian appeared near the double doors that led to the corridor, maintaining his position as we filed past him. His measured smile remained constant, that professional expression that somehow conveyed both protection and warning. He'd been the steady presence through my entire adaptation process, appearing when needed to handle situations that exceeded my ability to manage alone. The corridor felt shorter tonight, though I knew the building's dimensions shifted according to rules I'd never fully understand. My feet found the familiar path back to the reception area, past the beige walls and under the fluorescent lighting that hummed with electrical consistency, unlike the erratic patterns on the factory floor. The glass doors ahead promised the transition back to the normal world, where physics worked predictably and shadows behaved according to the laws of light and obstruction. I pushed through the doors into the cool morning air. The parking lot gravel crunched under my work boots as I walked toward my Honda, which sat between the same rusted pickup and old sedan that had been there since my first night.The factory building behind me appeared deceptively ordinary from the outside, just another small manufacturing facility with painted windows and modest signage that revealed nothing about the impossible spaces contained within its walls. My keys felt solid and normal in my hand, a tangible connection to the rational world that existed beyond Meridian Manufacturing's boundaries. The Honda's engine turned over with its familiar grinding sound that indicated needed repairs I could now afford to address. The dashboard clock read 6:03 AM as I pulled out of the gravel lot and onto the empty street. The morning sun painted everything in warm, ordinary light that made the night's work feel like something from a half-remembered dream. But the weight of the laminated rule card in my pocket and the steady ache in my hands from hours of packaging reminded me that every shift had been completely real. I'd learned to thrive in a place where accepting the impossible was simply the cost of steady employment. Traffic lights blinked yellow at empty intersections as I drove home through the quiet residential streets. The radio offered morning news about normal problems, weather forecasts, traffic reports, political developments that belong to a world where the strangest workplace hazard might be a broken coffee machine or inadequate ventilation. I'd become part of something far more complex, a hidden economy that operated according to different rules entirely. My apartment building appeared ahead, the same unremarkable complex where I'd spent those desperate months of unemployment, but everything had changed since then. The financial pressure that had driven me to accept any available work had been replaced by something approaching stability. More than that, I'd discovered an ability to adapt and survive in circumstances that would've broken the person I'd been three months ago. I parked in my assigned space and climbed the stairs to my unit, already planning the day's sleep schedule that would prepare me for another night shift. The routine had become as natural as breathing. Work the night, sleep the day, return to the factory when darkness fell. Each cycle reinforced my understanding of how to navigate the impossible while maintaining my sanity and collecting reliable paychecks. Inside my apartment, I placed the rule card on the kitchen counter next to my keys, a ritual that marked the transition between worlds. The normal furnishings, couch, television, kitchen appliances reminded me that ordinary reality still existed, even if I'd learned to function in spaces where ordinary rules didn't apply. My reflection in the bathroom mirror showed the same face I'd always had, unchanged by months of exposure to things that shouldn't exist. The achievement felt strange to acknowledge, but undeniable. I'd found stable work in an unstable world, discovered employment that paid well despite or perhaps because of the extraordinary demands it placed on workers. The factory claimed those who couldn't adapt, but rewarded those who learned to accept what couldn't be explained. I'd proven myself capable of that acceptance. Tomorrow night, I'd return to line seven, take my position between Ember and Gary, and continue the work that had become both livelihood and test of survival. The building would stretch into impossible dimensions, voices would call from empty spaces, and shadows would move according to laws that had nothing to do with physics. I'd ignore what needed ignoring, signal Christian when intervention became necessary, and maintain the steady rhythm of packaging that had become my anchor in a reality that defied rational explanation. As I settled into bed, the morning sun filtering through apartment windows that looked out onto a perfectly normal parking lot, I felt a strange sense of accomplishment wash over me. I'd found stable work in an unstable world, and despite everything I had witnessed and endured, I was determined to keep coming back each night. I had learned to thrive in the darkness."
