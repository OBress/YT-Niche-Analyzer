  "full_text": "I learned early that Westvale had one rule nobody talked about but everyone followed: don't look at Eastmarch. The settlement sat across Grayvale Valley, maybe three miles of dark water separating us from whatever lived over there. Adults would turn their backs when they walked past places where you could see it. Kids got yanked inside if they stared too long from the wrong window. Even the dogs seemed to know better than to bark in that direction. My friends and I broke that rule every chance we got. There were five of us back then. Douglas Rush was our unofficial leader, though he barely said 10 words most days. When he did speak, we listened. He had this way of making decisions that felt final, like arguing would be pointless. Scott Noble was the opposite, couldn't shut up if his life depended on it. Always cracking jokes, always moving, always finding new ways to get us in trouble. Curtis Walker asked questions about everything, the kind of careful, thoughtful questions that made adults uncomfortable. And Jackson Reyes lied about everything, but he did it so well and with such obvious enjoyment that we didn't mind. His stories were better than the truth most of the time. Then there was me, Jerry Bell. I remembered things. Not just the big stuff, but details that seemed to stick in my head long after everyone else forgot them. Sometimes I wished I could forget things the way other people did. Carrying all those memories felt heavy, especially the ones from later that nobody wanted to talk about. We had our favorite spots for watching Eastmarch. South Quarry Rocks gave us the best view on clear days. You could see the buildings, small, dark shapes that looked wrong somehow, like they'd been built by people who had different ideas about how buildings should look. Upper Barley Fields worked when the wind was right and the trees weren't blocking everything. Westvale Shore was risky because adults walked by more often, but on foggy mornings, you could sometimes catch glimpses when the mist shifted just right. We'd spend hours up there, passing around Curtis's father's binoculars when we could sneak them out of the house. Douglas would study the place like he was planning something. Scott would make up stories about what the people over there were doing. Curtis would ask questions nobody could answer. Why didn't we ever see smoke from their chimneys? Why didn't boats ever cross the water? Why did the buildings look like they were built wrong? Jackson would spin elaborate tales about secret tunnels and underground cities and people who lived backwards through time. I'd watch and remember every detail, the way the buildings seemed to lean away from each other, how the streets looked too wide and too empty, the fact that we never saw anyone moving around even though the place was clearly inhabited. Someone had to be living there. The buildings were maintained. The paths were clear. But it was like watching a town full of ghosts. The adults in Westvale talked around Eastmarch the way they talked around other uncomfortable subjects. When pressed, they'd say things like, \"Those people keep to themselves,\" or, \"Best to mind our own business.\" But their faces would tighten up and they'd change the subject fast. My mother once caught me staring across the valley from our kitchen window and pulled the curtains shut so hard the rod nearly came down. She didn't say anything, just gave me a look that made it clear the conversation was over before it started. That kind of reaction only made us more curious. Kids aren't wired to leave mysteries alone, especially when adults are obviously hiding something. The more they avoided talking about Eastmarch, the more we wanted to know what was over there. It became an obsession for all of us, but Douglas seemed to take it more seriously than the rest. He'd get this distant look when he watched the place, like he was working out a puzzle in his head. The weather had been strange that autumn, more fog than usual. And when it cleared, the air stayed so still you could see details across the valley that normally got lost in the haze. We'd been meeting up almost every day after school, finding excuses to walk by places where we could get a good look. Our parents probably thought we were just wandering around the way kids do, but we had purpose. We were studying Eastmarch, learning its rhythms, trying to figure out what made it different. That's how we ended up behind the Westvale storehouse on a Tuesday afternoon in late October. The building blocked us from view of the main street, and there was an old grain cart someone had abandoned back there years ago. The wood was weathered gray and one wheel had come off, leaving it tilted at an angle that made a decent bench if you didn't mind sitting crooked. Douglas had called the meeting. He didn't usually do that. We just sort of found each other most days. But he'd made a point of telling each of us to be there at 4 o'clock, which meant he had something specific on his mind. That should've been my first warning. When Douglas planned ahead, it usually meant trouble. Scott got there first, already perched on the high end of the tilted cart and swinging his legs. He'd been in a weird mood all week, more restless than usual, making jokes that didn't quite land right. Curtis showed up a few minutes later, pushing his glasses up his nose the way he did when he was nervous about something. Jackson arrived with some elaborate story about why he was late, something involving a runaway chicken and his neighbor's laundry line that was probably complete fiction, but entertaining enough that we didn't care. Douglas came last, which was unusual for him. He walked around the corner of the storehouse with that purposeful stride he got when he'd made up his mind about something.The rest of us were already settled on or around the grain cart, but he stayed standing. That was another warning sign I should've paid attention to. Douglas only stayed standing when he had something important to say. He looked at each of us in turn, that serious expression he got when he was thinking hard about something. The afternoon was getting cooler, and shadows from the storehouse were starting to stretch across the ground where we sat. Somewhere in the distance, I could hear Mrs. Henderson calling her cat in for dinner. \"We need to go see it,\" Douglas said, just like that. No build-up, no explanation. He might as well have been commenting on the weather, but we all knew immediately what he meant. There was only one it that mattered to any of us. Scott stopped swinging his legs. Curtis went very still behind his glasses. Jackson's usual grin faded into something more serious. I felt my stomach do something complicated, like it was trying to tie itself in knots. \"Go see what?\" Curtis asked, even though we all knew. \"Eastmarch,\" Douglas said. \"Cross the valley, see what's actually over there.\" The words hung in the air between us like something physical. I thought about it before. We all had. But thinking about something and hearing it said out loud were different things. Thinking about it was safe. Saying it out loud made it real, made it possible. \"That's crazy,\" Scott said, but his voice didn't have its usual joking tone. He sounded like he was testing the idea, seeing how it felt in his mouth. \"Why?\" Douglas asked. \"Why is it crazy?\" Curtis pushed his glasses up again. \"Because nobody goes there. Because our parents told us not to. Because there's probably a reason people avoid that place.\" \"What reason?\" Douglas said. \"Name one actual reason.\" Curtis opened his mouth and closed it again. That was the problem with all the warnings about Eastmarch. They were all vague. Don't go there. Don't look too long. Mind your own business. But nobody ever explained why. Nobody ever gave us a concrete reason to stay away. \"Maybe there isn't a reason,\" Jackson said slowly. \"Maybe it's just one of those things adults say because their parents said it, and their parents said it because their parents said it.\" \"Or maybe there's a really good reason, and they don't want to scare us,\" Curtis countered. \"Then why not just tell us?\" Scott asked. \"If there's something dangerous over there, wouldn't it make more sense to explain what it is?\" Douglas nodded like Scott had made his point for him. \"They don't tell us because they don't know either. They're just following the same rule we are, but they've been doing it so long they forgot why it started.\" I wanted to argue with him, but part of me thought he might be right. The adults in Westvale had that same uncomfortable look whenever Eastmarch came up, like they were repeating something they'd been taught but never really understood. Maybe the original reason for avoiding the place had gotten lost somewhere along the way, and now everyone was just going through the motions. \"So what are you suggesting?\" I asked, though I was pretty sure I already knew. Douglas looked directly at me when he answered. \"We cross the valley. We go see for ourselves what's over there. We find out if there's actually something to be afraid of or if it's just a stupid rule that doesn't mean anything anymore.\" My stomach tightened again. The idea terrified me and excited me in equal measure. We'd spent so much time watching Eastmarch from a distance, speculating about what might be there. The chance to actually see it, to walk those two wide streets and look at those wrong-angled buildings up close was tempting in a way that made my hands shake a little. \"How would we even get there?\" Curtis asked. \"It's three miles across the water.\" \"Boat,\" Douglas said simply. \"There are plenty of them down at the dock. We take one early in the morning before anyone's awake, row across, look around, come back.\" \"Steal a boat, you mean,\" Curtis said. \"Borrow a boat,\" Douglas corrected. \"We'd bring it back.\" Scott let out a nervous laugh. \"Oh well, if we're bringing it back, that makes it totally fine.\" But I could tell he was considering it. We all were. The plan was simple enough to actually work, which made it more frightening than if Douglas had suggested something obviously impossible. \"When?\" Scott asked, and I felt something cold settle in my chest. He wasn't arguing against the idea anymore. He was asking for details. \"Two days,\" Douglas said. \"Thursday morning before sunrise. Meet at the dock at five o'clock.\" \"Why Thursday?\" Jackson asked. \"Because that gives us time to think about it,\" Douglas said. \"If anyone wants to back out, they can. But if we're going to do this, we do it right. Early enough that nobody sees us leave, late enough in the week that people might not notice we're gone until we're back.\" Curtis was shaking his head slowly. \"This is a bad idea. This is a really bad idea.\" \"Maybe,\" Douglas agreed. \"But it's our bad idea, and I'm tired of wondering.\" I understood what he meant. The curiosity had been building in all of us for months, maybe years. Every time we watched Eastmarch from our various hiding spots, every time an adult changed the subject when it came up, every time we caught a glimpse of those strange buildings across the water, the questions got stronger. What was over there? Why didn't anyone talk about it? What were we all so afraid of?\"I need to think about it,\" Curtis said. \"That's fine,\" Douglas said. \"We all do. But Thursday morning, five o'clock, anyone who wants to come, be at the dock. Anyone who doesn't, stay home.\" He turned and walked away without waiting for a response, leaving the four of us sitting on the broken grain cart in the growing shadows. For a long moment, nobody said anything. The whole idea was so big, so different from anything we'd done before that it was hard to know how to react. \"He's serious,\" Scott said finally. \"Yeah,\" Jackson agreed. \"He's serious.\" Curtis was still shaking his head. \"We're going to get in so much trouble.\" \"Only if we get caught,\" Scott pointed out. \"We're going to get caught,\" Curtis said. \"And when we do, we're going to be in the worst trouble of our lives.\" He was probably right. But as I sat there thinking about it, I realized that didn't matter as much as it should have. The pull of Eastmarch, the need to finally know what was over there, felt stronger than my fear of getting in trouble. It felt stronger than almost anything. \"Are you going to do it?\" Jackson asked me. I looked across the space between buildings, toward where I knew the valley lay hidden behind the storehouse and the trees. Somewhere across that dark water, Eastmarch waited. Those strange buildings, those empty streets, whatever secrets the adults in Westvale had been keeping from us for as long as I could remember. \"Yeah,\" I said. And the word felt heavy coming out of my mouth. \"I think I am.\" Scott nodded slowly. \"Me too.\" Jackson grinned, but it wasn't his usual careless smile. This one had an edge to it, like he was excited and terrified at the same time. \"Well, I'm not missing this.\" We all looked at Curtis. He was quiet for a long time, staring at his hands folded in his lap. When he finally looked up, his face was pale behind his glasses. \"I don't want to,\" he said. \"But I don't wanna be the only one who doesn't go either.\" That settled it. Thursday morning, five o'clock. We'd row across Greysvale Valley and see Eastmarch for ourselves. We'd finally get answers to all the questions that had been eating at us for so long. I should have been more afraid than I was. I should have listened to the part of my brain that was screaming warnings about how wrong this felt. But the curiosity was stronger than the fear, and the need to know was stronger than the need to be safe. Two days felt like forever and no time at all. As we walked away from the grain cart and the storehouse, splitting up to head home for dinner, I could feel the weight of what we'd decided settling over me. In 48 hours, we'd either have our answers or we'd be in more trouble than we'd ever imagined. The forbidden settlement across the water had been calling to us for years. Thursday morning, we were finally going to answer. My eyes opened in complete darkness, and I knew without checking the time that it was Thursday morning. The house sat silent around me, not even the usual creaking of settling wood or the distant sound of early risers starting their day. My parents wouldn't be awake for another two hours at least, which meant I had enough time to slip out without anyone noticing. I'd barely slept. Every time I'd started to drift off, my mind would jolt back to what we were about to do, cross the valley, actually set foot in Eastmarch. After years of watching from a distance, we were finally going to get our answers. The thought made my stomach twist with equal parts excitement and dread. I dressed quietly in the dark, pulling on my heaviest shirt and the pants I'd laid out the night before. My boots were by the bedroom door where I'd left them, and I carried them downstairs rather than risk the noise of walking in them. The kitchen felt enormous in the predawn silence. Every small sound magnified. I grabbed the water flask I'd filled the night before and the wrapped bread from the pantry shelf, stuffing both into the canvas bag I'd borrowed from my father's workshop. The front door opened without its usual groan, and I stepped into the cold morning air. The world felt different at this hour, hushed and expectant. Stars still dotted the sky, but there was a faint lightening along the eastern horizon that meant sunrise wasn't far off. We needed to be across the water and back before full daylight brought the risk of being spotted by early fishermen or dockworkers. My feet knew the way to Westvale Dock even in the dim light. I'd walked these streets countless times, but never with this sense of purpose, never knowing I was about to break the most fundamental rule of our town. The houses I passed were dark and silent, their windows like closed eyes. I wondered what the people inside would think if they knew what we were planning. Would they try to stop us? Would they understand? The smell hit me before I could see the dock clearly. River rope, thick and wet from the constant moisture. Barnacles clinging to the wooden posts, their sharp edges cutting through the softer scents. Bait barrels lined up near the fishing boats, their contents adding a fish and salt tang to the air. All of it mixed together into something that meant water and boats and the beginning of our journey. Predawn blue hung over everything, that strange half-light that made familiar shapes look foreign and uncertain. Westvale felt like a different town entirely, as if we'd already crossed into unknown territory just by being awake at this hour.... the dock stretched out into the water like a wooden finger pointing toward Eastmarch, and I could see the dark shapes of boats tied along its length. \"Jerry.\" Douglas's voice came from the shadows near the dock's edge. He was already there, standing beside one of the mooring posts with his own bag slung over his shoulder. Even in the dim light, I could see the tension in his posture, the way he held himself ready for action. \"You made it,\" I said, keeping my voice low even though there was no one around to hear us. \"Course I did.\" Douglas never showed doubt, not even now when we were about to do something that could get us in more trouble than we'd ever faced. \"The others will be here.\" As if summoned by his words, Scott appeared from the direction of Miller Street, moving at his usual quick pace, but trying to stay quiet. His canvas bag bounced against his hip as he walked, and I could hear the muffled clink of whatever he'd brought with him. Behind him, moving more slowly and carefully, came Curtis. Even from a distance, I could see him pushing his glasses up his nose, a nervous habit that meant he was having second thoughts. \"This is really happening,\" Scott said when he reached us. His voice carried a mix of excitement and disbelief as if he couldn't quite accept that we were actually going through with Douglas' plan. Curtis joined our small group near the mooring post, shifting his weight from foot to foot. \"I brought the compass,\" he said, patting his bag. \"It's cracked, but it still works. And rope, my father's good rope.\" \"Hammer,\" Scott announced, hefting his bag. \"Figured we might need to break something open or knock something down.\" I showed them my water and bread. \"Figured we'd get hungry.\" Douglas nodded at each contribution, then shouldered his own bag. \"Knife, more rope, extra flask.\" He turned toward the boats tied along the dock. \"We need the skiff at the far end, the one nobody uses for regular fishing.\" We followed him along the wooden planks, our footsteps muffled, but still audible in the morning quiet. The dock felt longer than usual, stretching out over water that looked black and endless in the predawn light. Boats rocked gently in their moorings, their masts and rigging creating a forest of vertical lines against the slowly lightening sky. The skiff Douglas led us to was smaller than the regular fishing boats, built for ferry work rather than hauling nets. Its hull was painted a faded blue-green that had probably been bright once, but now looked weathered and practical. Two sets of oars lay across the center seats, and the boat itself looked solid enough to get us across the valley and back. \"Ferry's skiff,\" Douglas said, running his hand along the gunwale. \"Owner uses it maybe once a month. Won't be missed for a few hours.\" I watched him untie the mooring lines with quick, efficient movements. His hands worked the knots like he'd done this before, though I knew he hadn't. Douglas just had that way about him, making everything look easier than it probably was. The boat drifted slightly as the lines came free, held in place only by Douglas' grip on the bow. \"Get in,\" he said. \"Careful not to rock it too much.\" Scott went first, stepping into the boat with more confidence than skill. The skiff tilted under his weight, and he grabbed the nearest seat to steady himself. Curtis followed more cautiously, testing each step before committing his full weight. I came next, feeling the boat respond to my movements, the way it wanted to tip and sway with every shift in balance. Douglas pushed us away from the dock before climbing in himself, settling into the stern seat and taking up the oars. Jackson still hadn't arrived, and for a moment, I wondered if he'd changed his mind, decided the risk was too great. Then I saw him jogging toward the dock, his bag bouncing against his back. \"Wait,\" he called in a loud whisper. \"Almost missed it.\" He practically jumped into the boat, making it rock violently before Douglas could steady us. \"Sorry, couldn't find my good boots in the dark.\" \"Sit down and stay still,\" Douglas said, already dipping the oars into the water. \"We're burning daylight.\" The first few strokes took us away from the dock and into the open water of the river. I felt the moment when we left the shallows behind, when the bottom dropped away beneath us and we were truly committed to the crossing. The dock grew smaller behind us, Westvale's familiar buildings fading into the blue-gray of early morning. I made myself not look back. Whatever happened next, we were past the point of changing our minds. The water stretched ahead of us, dark and wide, with Eastmarch waiting on the far shore. I'd spent years staring across this valley, wondering what we'd find over there. Now, I was finally going to get my answer. Douglas and Jackson settled into a rhythm with the oars, pulling us steadily across the current. The water was deeper here than I'd expected, dark enough that I couldn't see the bottom even in the growing light. Small waves lapped against the hull with a gentle slapping sound that seemed too loud in the morning quiet. Ground fog was starting to lift from the water, thin wisps that curled up from the surface and drifted away on the slight breeze. Through the shifting mist, I could see Eastmarch Slope emerging more clearly than ever before. The buildings looked even stranger from this angle, their odd angles and tilted walls more pronounced when viewed from water level. Streets that had seemed merely wide from our distant observation points-... now looked enormous. Empty spaces between structures that didn't quite make sense. \"Look at that,\" Curtis said quietly, pointing toward the approaching shore. \"The houses really are wrong.\" He was right. What we'd attributed to distance and poor viewing angles was actually there, built into the very structure of the settlement. Roof lines that should've been parallel, instead slanted away from each other. Windows that should've been square looked trapezoidal. Even the docks we were approaching seemed to extend into the water at odd angles, as if whoever built them had been working from plans that didn't quite match reality. \"Maybe they just build different over there,\" Scott said, but his voice lacked conviction. \"Different style or something.\" I didn't think it was a matter of style. The wrongness went deeper than that, into the basic geometry of how things were put together. It made my eyes want to slide away, to look at something else that made more sense. We were halfway across when Scott's voice changed, \"Guys, look at the water.\" I followed his pointed finger to the dark surface beside our boat. At first, I didn't see anything unusual, just the gentle ripples created by our passage. Then something moved beneath the surface, a shadow that was too regular to be debris or plant matter. \"What is that?\" Curtis asked, leaning forward to get a better look. Douglas kept rowing, but turned his head to follow our stares. \"Fins,\" he said matter-of-factly. Swimming beside us, the shapes became clearer as more of them appeared, dark forms gliding under the water in slow, deliberate arcs. They moved with purpose, keeping pace with our boat, but staying just deep enough to remain partially hidden. I counted at least six of them, maybe more. \"Fish?\" Jackson asked, but his voice suggested he already knew better. \"Blacktip river sharks,\" Douglas said, pulling harder on the oars. \"They follow boats sometimes, looking for scraps or bait.\" Sharks. The word sent a chill through me that had nothing to do with the morning air. I'd heard stories about blacktips in the river, but always dismissed them as fishermen's tales meant to keep kids away from deep water. Seeing them now, their dark shapes cutting through the water with predatory grace made those stories feel very real. \"Are they dangerous?\" Curtis asked, his voice climbing toward panic. \"Not usually,\" Douglas said, but he was rowing faster now, making the boat surge forward with each stroke. \"But I'd rather not find out.\" Jackson picked up the second set of oars and joined Douglas in pulling us toward Eastmarch. The increased speed made the boat pitch and sway more dramatically, and I had to grip the gunnel to keep my balance. Cold water sloshed over the center plank with each stroke, soaking through my boots and making the bottom of the boat slippery. The sharks seemed to respond to our increased speed by swimming closer to the surface. I could see them more clearly now, sleek shapes with pointed snouts and the distinctive dark tips on their fins that gave them their name. They moved with an efficiency that was both beautiful and terrifying, cutting through the water like they owned it. \"How much farther?\" Scott asked, his eyes fixed on the water around us. \"Almost there,\" Douglas replied, but his breathing was getting heavier from the effort of rowing fast. Sweat stood out on his forehead despite the cool morning air. That's when I felt it, a dull impact against the hull, like someone had struck the boat with a heavy stick. The sound was muffled by the water, but unmistakable. A solid thunk that vibrated through the wooden planks beneath my feet. \"They're bumping us,\" I said, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. Another impact, stronger this time, made the boat lurch to one side. Curtis grabbed the nearest seat with both hands, his knuckles white with tension. Scott had gone completely silent, which was more frightening than if he'd been making jokes. \"Row harder,\" Douglas commanded, and Jackson responded by pulling so hard on his oars that he nearly lost his balance. The shore was getting closer, but not fast enough. I could see the strange angles of Eastmarch's buildings more clearly now, the twisted geometry that made my head hurt if I looked at it too long. The docks extended into the water like gnarled fingers. Their wooden posts covered with something that looked like moss, but moved in the current like it was alive. Another bump, this one hard enough to make water splash over the side. The boat was taking on water faster now, and I could feel it getting heavier, more sluggish in response to the oars. We were still 100 yards from shore, maybe more. \"There,\" Curtis said suddenly, pointing ahead. \"Rocks.\" I saw them too, dark shapes just beneath the surface near what looked like a ford or shallow crossing. The water was lighter there, indicating depth changes that could mean either safety or disaster, depending on how we approached them. \"Eastmarch Ford,\" Douglas said between strokes. \"We can beach there.\" But the boat was getting harder to control. Water had pooled around our feet, and every shark bump made us list further to one side. Jackson was pulling on his oars with desperate strength, but we were fighting both the current and the weight of the water we'd taken on. The impact, when it came, wasn't from below. We hit something solid and unyielding, a hidden shoal that the ford's shallow water had concealed. The sound was like a gunshot, wood splintering against stone.... the boat lurched violently to one side, and I felt the hull crack along its length. Our supplies slid toward the low side of the boat, canvas bags and rope and tools all tumbling together as the skiff listed at an impossible angle. Water poured in through the crack, and I realized with a sick certainty that we weren't going to make it to shore in the boat. \"Abandon ship!\" Douglas shouted, already standing and preparing to jump into the shallow water of the ford. Get to shore now. The boat was going down, the sharks were still circling, and Eastmarch waited ahead of us with its wrong angles and empty streets. We'd wanted answers, and now we were going to get them whether we were ready or not. I hit the water and it slammed into my chest with the force of a closed door. The cold shocked every nerve in my body awake at once. And before I could even process what was happening, the current grabbed my ankles and yanked them sideways. My feet scrambled for purchase on nothing but rushing water, and panic shot through me as I realized how deep the ford actually was once you got away from the immediate shallows. Something slick brushed against my left foot, and my mind immediately went to the sharks. They were still down there, probably confused by all the splashing and movement, but definitely present. I kicked harder, not caring about technique or efficiency, just desperate to get away from whatever had touched me. The water was murky from all the sediment we'd stirred up abandoning the boat, and I couldn't see more than a few inches below the surface. My lungs burned as I fought against the current. The shore looked impossibly far away, even though I knew it couldn't be more than 20 or 30 feet, but the water kept trying to push me downstream, away from where I needed to go. And every stroke felt like I was swimming through thick soup. My clothes weighed me down, the canvas bag I'd somehow managed to keep strapped across my shoulder dragging like an anchor. Behind me, I could hear the others splashing and shouting, but I didn't dare turn around to look. All my focus had to stay on reaching that rocky shore ahead of me. The buildings of Eastmarch loomed above the waterline, their wrong angles even more disturbing now that I was this close. The roof lines seemed to lean away from each other at impossible degrees, creating shadows that fell in directions that made no sense. Another few desperate strokes and my fingers finally scraped against something solid. River cobble, smooth and slippery but real. I grabbed at the stones with both hands, trying to haul myself up out of the water, but my grip kept slipping on the wet rocks. My elbows scraped raw against the sharp edges as I clawed my way forward, leaving streaks of blood on the gray stone. The current was still trying to pull me back, and for a terrifying moment, I thought I might lose my grip entirely. My fingers found a larger rock, something I could actually hold onto, and I used it to drag myself further up onto the shore. Water streamed from my clothes as I finally got my knees under me, gasping and shaking from the cold and exertion. Douglas hauled himself up beside me, water pouring from his dark hair. His face was grim as he looked back toward where we'd abandoned the boat. Scott came next, his usual jokes completely absent as he collapsed onto the cobbles, breathing hard. Curtis emerged from the water looking pale and shaken. His glasses somehow still on his face, but completely fogged over. Jackson was the last to reach shore, and when he did, he immediately turned back to stare at the water. Our skiff was already disappearing into the fog that hung over the river. All our supplies were going down with it, the rope, the extra water, Scott's hammer, Curtis' compass, everything we'd brought to help us explore Eastmarch. We were stranded here now, with nothing but the clothes on our backs and whatever we'd managed to keep in our pockets. I watched the boat's outline fade into the gray mist until I couldn't see it anymore. The finality of it hit me like a physical blow. We'd crossed the valley, just like Douglas had planned, but now we had no way back. Whatever we found in Eastmarch, we were going to have to deal with it without supplies and without an easy escape route. Standing on the shore, dripping and cold, I tried to get my bearings. This was Eastmarch's shore, the place we'd stared at from across the valley for years. But now that I was actually here, something felt immediately wrong about it. Not wrong in an obvious way, but wrong in a way that made my skin crawl without being able to pinpoint exactly why. The landscape looked familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. There was a willow tree near the water's edge, its branches drooping toward the river just like the one on Westvale's shore. But this willow was crooked, leaning at an angle that seemed too severe for a healthy tree. Its leaves were the right color, the right shape, but they hung differently somehow, as if gravity worked slightly differently here. A cluster of black rocks jutted up from the shore about 50 feet to our left, worn smooth by decades of river water. They looked almost identical to the rock formation on our side of the valley, the one we'd climbed on as children. But these rocks were arranged in a pattern that was just different enough to be unsettling. The largest one was in the wrong position, creating a shadow that fell where no shadow should fall. Even the grass was wrong. It was green, the same shade we had back home, but it seemed to grow in slightly different patterns.The spacing between individual blades was off, creating a texture that looked normal from a distance, but became increasingly strange the more you focused on it. The color was right, but somehow too bright, too vivid, like someone had tried to recreate normal grass from memory and gotten the details almost, but not quite correct. The slope that led up from the shore matched Westvale's geography closely enough to be recognizable, but the angle was different, steeper in some places, gentler in others, creating a landscape that felt like a distorted reflection of home. The trees that dotted the hillside were spaced wrong. Their branches reaching in directions that created an unnatural rhythm across the slope. What really caught my attention though was the path. On Westvale shore, there was no path leading up from the water. The slope was just grass and scattered rocks, too steep to climb easily in most places. But here, a narrow trail cut through the hillside, winding its way up toward the buildings above. It looked old, well-worn, as if people had been using it regularly for years. The path was just wide enough for single file, carved into the slope with deliberate precision. Someone had taken the time to clear the rocks and level the ground, creating a route that switchbacked up the hill in a series of gentle curves. It was the kind of path that spoke of regular use, of people who needed to travel between the shore and the settlement above on a routine basis. Douglas was already looking at the path, water still dripping from his clothes. He didn't say anything, but I could see the decision forming in his expression. We'd come this far, lost our boat, nearly been eaten by sharks, and now we were standing on forbidden ground with no easy way home. The only direction left was up. He started walking toward the path without waiting for discussion or agreement. That was Douglas. Once he'd made a decision, he acted on it immediately. Scott fell in behind him, then Curtis, still trying to clear the fog from his glasses. Jackson hesitated for a moment, looking back at the river one more time, then followed the group. I took the rear position, partly because someone needed to watch behind us and partly because I wanted to keep an eye on the others. The path felt solid under my feet, more solid than it had any right to be given how recently it must've been used. The dirt was packed hard, worn smooth by countless footsteps over what must've been years of regular traffic. As we climbed, the humidity seemed to thicken around us. The air felt heavier here than it did back home, pressing against my skin in a way that made breathing feel slightly more difficult. It wasn't oppressive exactly, but it was noticeable, like the atmosphere itself was denser on this side of the valley. The grass moved too readily for the amount of breeze we were getting. Back home, grass this thick would barely sway in a light wind, but here, it responded to every tiny air current as if it weighed almost nothing. The movement created a constant rustling sound that was just loud enough to be distracting, just persistent enough to make me keep glancing at it from the corner of my eye. We'd been walking for maybe 30 paces when Jackson suddenly stopped dead in his tracks. The rest of us nearly bumped into each other as the line came to an abrupt halt. Jackson was staring off to our right, toward a section of the hillside that looked no different from any other part of the slope we'd been passing. I followed his gaze, scanning the grass and scattered rocks for whatever had caught his attention. At first, I didn't see anything unusual, just more of the same too green grass, more of the same wrongly spaced trees, more of the same landscape that looked almost, but not quite like home. Then I saw her. A very tall woman was standing motionless in the grass about 100 feet up the hillside from our path. She was so still that at first glance, she might've been a tree or a large rock, something that belonged to the landscape rather than a living person. But once I focused on her, there was no mistaking what I was looking at. She had to be well over six feet tall, maybe closer to seven, with a thin frame that made her height even more pronounced. Her clothes were dark, a long dress or robe that hung straight down without any wind to move it. Her hair was long and black, hanging loose around her shoulders and her skin was pale enough to stand out against the dark fabric. But what really unsettled me was how perfectly still she was. Not just standing still, but motionless in a way that seemed almost inhuman. No shifting weight from foot to foot, no small movements of her head or hands, no sign that she was even breathing. She stood like a statue, facing in our direction but showing no indication that she'd noticed us at all. The five of us stood frozen on the path, staring up at this impossibly tall woman who seemed to be staring back at us without moving a muscle. The woman's posture caught my attention first, the way she held herself upright, but wrong as though someone had described proper human stance from memory and gotten the details slightly off. Her shoulders sat too square, her spine too rigid, like she'd been positioned rather than having chosen to stand that way. The dark fabric of her dress hung against her frame in a way that suggested dampness, clinging where it should've fallen free, outlining the sharp angles of her body beneath. Her arms bothered me most. They hung at her sides with a weight that seemed unnatural. Fingers pointing straight down without the slight curl that comes from relaxed muscles.Nothing about her moved. The grass around her feet swayed in the breeze that I could feel against my own face, bending and straightening in constant motion, but she remained absolutely still. Not the stillness of someone trying to remain motionless, but the complete absence of the tiny movements that mark something as alive. I found myself cataloging the wrongness, the way my mind does when it encounters something it can't quite process. Her breathing, I couldn't detect any rise and fall of her chest. The small shifts of weight that people make without thinking absent. Even the way hair moves in wind, the way fabric responds to the body beneath it, all of it missing from her. She stood like a figure carved from wood and painted to look human, but the artist had never seen a living person up close. Then she smiled. The expression that spread across her face violated every understanding I had of how human features worked. Her mouth corners bent downward in what should have been a frown, pulling toward her jaw in a way that suggested sadness or disapproval, but her cheeks lifted simultaneously, pushing upward against her eyes in the motion of joy. The corners of her eyes crinkled with apparent warmth while her mouth maintained its downward curve. The two halves of her face performed opposite emotions at the same time, creating something that my brain kept trying to interpret as happiness, but felt fundamentally wrong. The mismatched geometry of her expression reversed everything I understood about how faces convey feeling. Joy became something twisted. Maternal warmth turned into a threat more unsettling than any snarl or glare could have been. Looking at that impossible smile made my stomach clench with a kind of wrongness that went deeper than fear. Fear, I could understand, could respond to. This was something else entirely. The sick feeling of seeing something that shouldn't exist wearing the mask of something comforting. Her eyes held that maternal warmth, the kind of gentle attention that mothers give their children when they're pleased or proud. But receiving that look from this thing, with her mouth curved in its backward smile, made me want to turn away and run. A direct threat would've been easier to process. Anger or hunger or even madness, those were things I could've understood. This corrupted kindness was worse than any of them. I watched her raise one finger, and the movement confirmed what I'd been sensing about her wrongness. The joints moved in the correct sequence, knuckle then second joint, then where the finger met her hand, but the angles were off. The bend happened too sharply at each point, like the joints belonged to something with different bone structure that had been fitted into a human-shaped frame. Her finger pointed with mechanical precision, no tremor or natural variance in the gesture. \"She's pointing behind us,\" Curtis said, his voice barely above a whisper. The sound of his words broke whatever spell had been holding us frozen on the path. I turned with the others, following the direction of that wrongly jointed finger, and saw them waiting in the shade beneath the cedar wood trees. Five figures stood perfectly spaced apart in the shadows, and I recognized each one immediately because I was looking at myself and my friends. Not similar-looking people who might've been mistaken for us at a distance, but exact duplicates down to the smallest details. My double wore the same clothes I had on, the same canvas bag across his shoulder, even the same scuff marks on his shoes from our scramble up the rocky shore. But the details were wrong in subtle ways that made my skin crawl. The buttons on his shirt were on the left side instead of the right. The strap of his bag crossed from right shoulder to left hip instead of left to right. His hair parted on the opposite side from mine. Everything had been mirrored, like someone had created these copies by looking at us in a reflection and building from that reversed image. The duplicate of Douglas stood where Douglas would've positioned himself, slightly ahead of the others, but his naturally confident posture had been replaced with something that looked rehearsed. Scott's double wore the same expression of nervous humor that Scott had been carrying since we'd left the boat, but frozen in place like a mask. Curtis' copy stood with the same cautious attention, but without the small movements of anxiety that marked the real Curtis. Jackson's duplicate had the same lanky frame and casual stance, but none of the restless energy that usually kept Jackson shifting from foot to foot. They were perfect copies, rendered imperfect by being too perfect. No fidgeting, no small adjustments of position, no natural variation in their expressions. They stood like actors who had been given detailed instructions about their roles, but had never actually lived the parts they were playing. My own double stared back at me with my own face, but the eyes held no recognition, no curiosity, no fear, nothing. They were my eyes in color and shape, but empty of everything that made them mine. Looking into them was like looking into a mirror that reflected only surfaces, never depth. The five duplicates maintained their positions without any sign of impatience or purpose. They weren't waiting for us to do something specific, weren't preparing to attack or defend or communicate.They simply stood there, existing in a way that felt both purposeful and completely meaningless. I looked back uphill toward the woman, needing to understand what was happening, what these things were, what any of this meant. She remained in the same position where we'd first seen her, that impossible smile still distorting her features. But as I watched, her body stayed rigidly upright while her head began to extend forward. Her neck stretched like something elastic, lengthening impossibly as her head moved toward us without her body taking a single step. The movement had no natural equivalent, not like a snake extending its head, not like any animal I'd ever seen. Her neck simply became longer, maintaining its width and apparent solidity, while adding length that shouldn't have been possible. Her face closed the distance between us with that horrible maternal smile still fixed in place. Her eyes maintaining their warm attention, while her mouth held its downward curve. The wrongness of watching her approach this way made me want to close my eyes, but I couldn't look away from the impossible geometry of her movement. When her face had extended close enough that I could see the individual pores in her pale skin, close enough that I should've been able to feel her breath if she had been breathing, she opened her mouth and screamed. The sound began as something I almost recognized, the deep groaning of a ship's hull under stress, wood and metal protesting against forces they weren't designed to withstand. But that familiar sound twisted into something underwater, like metal tearing apart in the depths where pressure changes everything. The groaning became shrieking, but muffled and distorted as though it was traveling through water to reach us. Then the pitch climbed beyond anything human vocal cords could produce, rising higher and higher until it passed the range of human hearing, and became something I felt rather than heard. The sound invaded my bones, vibrated through my skull, made my teeth ache, and my vision blur. It was the sound of something that had learned to mimic human vocalization, but had never understood what voices were actually for. The scream continued climbing in pitch until it existed somewhere beyond sound entirely, becoming a pressure in the air that made my ears feel like they were going to burst. I wanted to cover my ears, wanted to run, wanted to do anything to escape that impossible noise, but I couldn't move. None of us could move. We stood frozen on the path while that thing with my mother's smile screamed at us with a voice that belonged to no living creature. The scream cut off like a blade through rope leaving absolute silence that felt worse than the noise. My bone still ached from that impossible sound. A deep throb that seemed to pulse with my heartbeat. I blinked hard trying to clear the spots dancing across my vision. And when I could see properly again, the hillside was empty, gone. The woman with her stretched neck and contradictory smile had simply vanished. No movement, no fade, no step backward into the trees. One moment she was there with her face extended toward us like some grotesque puppet, and the next moment, nothing but grass and shadows remained where she'd stood. I turned toward the cedar wood trees where our duplicates had been waiting in their frozen poses, but those spaces were empty too. Five patches of disturbed earth marked where they'd stood, but the figures themselves had disappeared as completely as if they'd never existed. My ears rang with phantom echoes of that scream. The sound had been so wrong, so far outside anything a human throat could produce that my mind kept trying to replay it and failing, like trying to remember a color that didn't exist. The memory slipped away each time I reached for it, leaving only the bone-deep ache and a sick feeling in my stomach. \"What just happened?\" Scott's voice came out as a croak. Nobody answered him. What could we say? That we'd seen a woman stretch her neck impossibly long? That perfect copies of ourselves had been standing under the trees? That a scream had paralyzed us completely before everything vanished? The words would sound insane even to us, and we'd lived through it. Curtis pushed his glasses up his nose with a shaking hand. The lenses had fogged again, but this time from his own rapid breathing rather than river water. He cleaned them methodically. A nervous habit I'd seen him do 100 times before, but his movements were jerky and wrong. \"I wanna go home,\" he whispered. The words hung in the air between us. We all wanted to go home. We wanted to be back in Westvale where things made sense, where people's necks didn't stretch, and where our own faces didn't stare back at us with empty eyes. But home was across a river we couldn't cross in a boat that had sunk, past sharks that might still be circling the ford. \"This is home,\" Jackson said. I turned to look at him. Something in his voice made my skin crawl. The words were right, technically accurate since we were still in Greyvale Valley, but the way he'd said them felt wrong. Too measured, too deliberate. Jackson usually spoke in bursts. Words tumbling over each other as his thoughts raced ahead. This careful cadence didn't match him at all. Douglas wiped water from his hair and looked around the hillside. His jaw was set in that stubborn line I knew well. The expression he got when he'd made a decision and wouldn't be swayed from it. Even after what we'd just witnessed, he wasn't ready to give up. \"We can't stay here,\" he said. Too exposed,He was right about that. The path where we stood offered no cover, no protection if that woman returned or if something worse appeared. The open hillside stretched above and below us, leaving us visible from any direction. My skin crawled with the feeling of being watched though I couldn't see anyone or anything observing us. \"The forest,\" Douglas continued, pointing toward the deeper treeline that crowned the hill. \"Better cover there.\" Curtis shook his head rapidly. \"No, no, we should go back to the shore, wait for a boat. Someone will come looking.\" \"Who?\" Douglas asked. \"Who's going to come looking for us here?\" The question hit home. Our parents wouldn't expect us back until evening, if then. Nobody in Westvale would think to look for us in Eastmarch. The adults who'd spent our entire lives warning us away from this place would never imagine we'd actually crossed over. We were on our own. \"Moving's better than standing still,\" Scott said. His usual joking tone was completely absent. \"Whatever that was, I don't wanna meet it again.\" Jackson nodded, but something about the movement seemed off. Too quick maybe, or too eager. I couldn't put my finger on what bothered me about it, but the wrongness was there. Douglas started walking toward the treeline without waiting for more discussion. After a moment's hesitation, Scott followed. Then Curtis, still cleaning his glasses obsessively. Jackson fell into step behind him, and I brought up the rear, looking back over my shoulder every few steps to make sure nothing was following us. The trees grew thicker as we climbed. What had seemed like normal forest from a distance revealed itself as something else entirely when we got close. The trunks were wrong. Not obviously wrong, not twisted into impossible shapes, but wrong in subtle ways that made my eyes ache trying to focus on them. Too many knots, for one thing. Every tree was covered in bulging knots that seemed to follow patterns I couldn't quite grasp. And the branches curled back toward their own trunks instead of reaching outward toward the light. I reached out to touch the bark of an oak tree and jerked my hand back immediately. It felt like damp cloth, soft and yielding under my fingertips. Not the rough, solid texture bark should have, but something organic and unpleasant. I wiped my hand on my pants, but the sensation lingered on my skin. The ground felt wrong too, loose and unstable, as if the earth had recently shifted or collapsed. Each step sank slightly deeper than it should, and I could feel the soil giving way beneath my weight. Not muddy exactly, but not solid either, like walking on a foundation that hadn't quite settled. Air moved differently here. Heavier, denser, making each breath require slightly more effort than it should. The smell hit me as we went deeper. Iron, sharp and metallic, mixed with the musty scent of mildew and something sweet and rotten underneath. Like fruit left too long in the sun, or meat beginning to spoil. I breathed through my mouth, but that only made the taste coat my tongue. Douglas pushed through a curtain of hanging branches, and we emerged into a small clearing bisected by a massive fallen trunk. The log was easily six feet across, covered in a thick carpet of moss that looked almost wet in the dim light. Veins of moisture ran through the moss like tiny streams, creating patterns that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them. \"What do you think it means?\" Douglas asked, settling onto the fallen trunk. \"What we saw back there.\" The soft mechanical click came from deeper in the forest before anyone could answer. A precise, deliberate sound that cut through the ambient rustling of leaves and branches. Click, like a latch being tested or a mechanism being engaged. We all froze. The sound was too regular, too purposeful to be natural. Trees didn't make clicking noises. Animals didn't move with that kind of mechanical precision. Something in the deeper forest was operating machinery, or something that sounded like machinery. Then came the second sound, the unmistakable groan of a lifting latch. Metal sliding against metal, followed by the creak of hinges under weight. A door opening somewhere ahead of us, though I couldn't see any structure through the trees. \"Did you hear that?\" Curtis whispered. We'd all heard it. The question was, what we were going to do about it? Every instinct I had screamed at me to turn around, to head back toward the shore, to put as much distance as possible between us and whatever was making those sounds. But Douglas was already standing, already looking toward the source of the noise with that expression of grim determination. The light was dimming around us, though when I looked up through the canopy, I couldn't see any clouds blocking the sun. The shadows between the trees were deepening, growing longer and darker despite the time of day. Everything felt muffled and distant, as if we were moving through a dream or viewing the world through thick glass. Douglas started walking toward the sound, not quickly, but with steady purpose. Scott followed after a moment, then Curtis, still muttering under his breath about wanting to go home. Jackson moved with that same too-eager step I'd noticed before, and I fell in behind them, my skin crawling with wrongness. The trees grew denser as we followed the sound deeper into the forest.Branches hung lower, forcing us to duck and weave between them. The bark cloth sensation was everywhere now, brushing against my arms and shoulders as we passed. The sweet rot smell grew stronger, mixing with the iron and mildew until the air felt thick enough to chew. We pushed through another wall of hanging branches, and found ourselves at the edge of a second clearing. This one was larger, maybe 30 feet across, with grass that looked too green and grew in patterns that hurt to follow. But it wasn't the grass that made us all stop walking. At the far end of the clearing stood a house. It was a simple structure, single story with weathered gray boards and a slumped porch that sagged under its own weight. Nothing remarkable about it. Nothing obviously threatening or supernatural. Just an old house that looked like it had been abandoned for years. Except it was here in the middle of East March Forest where no house should be. The front door stood slightly ajar, a slice of darkness visible between the door and frame. That was where the latch sound had come from. Someone or something had opened that door and was waiting inside for us to find it. Jackson walked toward the house without saying anything. The rest of us followed, but I found myself watching him more than the building ahead. Something about his movement bothered me. His steps were too even, too measured. Jackson usually bounced when he walked, always had energy to burn, but now he moved like he was walking a straight line painted on the ground. The porch came into view as we got closer. Weathered gray boards, sagging support beam. Nothing unusual about the construction itself, but those posts holding up the overhang made my chest tighten. I knew those posts. Thick, square columns with beveled edges, and that particular way the wood grain ran in dark streaks down the length. They were identical to the ones on the Reyes family home on Bread Lane back in Westvale. Exactly identical down to a small gouge near the base of the left post where Jackson had accidentally hit it with his father's ax two summers ago. Jackson stepped onto the porch like he belonged there. The boards didn't creak under his weight, which struck me as wrong. Old wood always made noise, always. But his feet landed silent on planks that should've groaned and settled. He reached for the door handle without hesitation, pushed it open wider, and walked inside like he was coming home from school. Douglas went next. Then Scott, then Curtis. I brought up the rear, my hand trailing along the porch railing as I climbed the three steps. The wood felt normal under my palm, rough and weathered like it should. But those posts kept drawing my attention. The gouge was there, exactly where it should be, exactly the right size and depth. How could that be possible? We were miles from Westvale in the middle of forest that shouldn't have any houses at all. The front door opened into a narrow hallway that stretched toward the back of the house. Stale wood smell hit me immediately, mixed with something else I couldn't identify. Something sweet and cloying that made me want to breathe through my mouth. The walls were painted pale yellow, faded and peeling in places with dark wood trim around the doorways. Nothing threatening about it. Nothing obviously supernatural. Just an old house that needed maintenance. But the proportions felt wrong. The hallway stretched too far back, and the ceiling seemed higher than it should be for a single story building. When I looked directly at the walls, they appeared normal. But in my peripheral vision, they seemed to bend slightly, like the whole space was stretched in directions that didn't make sense. Douglas moved down the hall toward what looked like a living room. Scott and Curtis followed, their footsteps echoing oddly in the confined space. Jackson had already disappeared around the corner ahead of us. I could hear him moving around in there, but no talking, no comments about what he was seeing. That bothered me too. Jackson always had something to say about everything. The hallway led into a main room with a stone fireplace on the far wall and windows on either side. Furniture scattered around in typical arrangements, couch facing the hearth, wooden chairs positioned for conversation. But the layout was backwards from what I expected. In the Reyes house back home, the living room was on the right side when you walked in the front door. Here it was on the left. Everything mirrored. Everything reversed. I stopped in the doorway and let my eyes adjust to the dimmer light. Photographs lined the walls in mismatched frames, dozens of them in no particular pattern. Family pictures mostly. People posed in front of houses, gathered around dinner tables, standing in groups at what looked like celebrations. Normal family photographs, except something about them made my skin crawl. The people in the pictures looked familiar, too familiar. I stepped closer to examine a large portrait near the fireplace, and my stomach dropped. It was the Reyes family, all of them. Jackson's parents, his younger sister Maria, his grandfather who died three years ago. They were posed in front of their house on Bread Lane wearing clothes I recognized from last summer's church picnic. The details were wrong, small things that took me a moment to identify. Jackson's father wore his watch on his right wrist instead of his left. Maria's birthmark usually on her left cheek appeared on her right.The front door of their house, which I knew opened to the right, seemed to open to the left in the photograph. Everything was flipped, like someone had taken a normal picture and reversed it. I moved to the next photograph. Same family, different pose, same wrongness. Watches on wrong wrists, parts and hair going the wrong direction. Even the buttons on their clothes seemed to be on the wrong sides. Every single detail that should go one way went the other instead. Douglas was examining bookshelves built into the wall beside the fireplace. He pulled out a volume, flipped through it, put it back. Curtis hovered near the cold hearth, pushing his glasses up his nose every few seconds. The habit was getting worse, more frequent. His hands shook slightly each time he reached for the frames. Scott stood in front of a painting hung above the mantel. Large canvas in an ornate gold frame depicting a landscape that looked exactly like our valley back home. The same hills, the same river cutting through the bottom, even the same cluster of buildings that made up Westvale on the far shore. But the river was flowing backwards. I knew which direction Silver Run River flowed. I'd watched it my entire life. Had thrown countless stones into its current. In this painting, the water moved the wrong way, defying everything I knew about the geography of home. A clock ticked on the mantel beside the painting, steady rhythm, but slightly off. Each tick came just a fraction of a second too late, like the mechanism was running slow, not broken, not stopped, just wrong. Half a beat behind where it should be. The sound got under my skin, made me want to reach up and stop the pendulum entirely. Jackson was nowhere to be seen. I realized I hadn't heard him moving around for several minutes, hadn't heard his voice since we entered the house. He'd been right ahead of us when we came through the front door, but now the room held only the four of us. \"Where did Jackson go?\" Scott asked, turning away from the backwards river painting. We all looked around the room. No Jackson. No sound of footsteps from other parts of the house. No voice calling out about what he'd found. Just the four of us and that slow-ticking clock and the smell of stale wood and something sweet. \"Jackson, Jackson,\" Douglas called out, his voice carrying through the house. No response, not even an echo. Curtis pushed his glasses up again. He was right in front of us. He had to go somewhere. I walked to the far end of the living room where a doorway led deeper into the house. The opening was dark, no light coming from whatever room lay beyond. I peered around the corner and saw a short hallway with two doors, both closed, one straight ahead, one to the right. \"Jackson?\" I called down the hall. Nothing. Douglas moved past me and tried the door straight ahead. The handle turned, but the door only opened an inch before hitting something solid. He put his shoulder against it and pushed. Whatever was blocking it from the other side didn't budge. \"Locked,\" he said, though that wasn't quite right. Blocked maybe, or barricaded. Scott tried the door to the right. It opened easily into what looked like a kitchen. Empty counters, old stove, sink with a hand pump. No Jackson. Scott opened cabinet doors, checked behind the kitchen table, even looked inside the pantry closet. Nothing. \"Maybe he went upstairs,\" Curtis suggested. I hadn't noticed stairs, but Curtis was right. A narrow staircase led up from the main hallway, tucked against the wall near the front door. How had I missed that when we came in? The steps were steep and painted the same faded yellow as the walls. Douglas climbed first, the old wood creaking under his weight. The sound was loud in the quiet house, each step announcing our presence to whatever might be waiting above. The rest of us followed, single file, hands trailing along the banister. The upstairs hallway was shorter than the one below, with two doors facing each other. Both stood slightly open. Douglas pushed the left door wider and stepped inside. I could see over his shoulder into a bedroom with a single bed, dresser and window overlooking the front yard. The bed was made, covers pulled tight, pillow positioned exactly in the center. Too neat, like a hotel room waiting for guests. But the window was wrong. From this angle, looking out over the front yard, I should have been able to see the path we'd taken from the forest edge. Instead, I saw a different yard entirely. Flower beds in neat rows, white picket fence, mailbox at the end of a gravel driveway. The yard from Jackson's house on Bread Lane viewed from his bedroom window. Scott checked the other bedroom while Douglas searched the first one more thoroughly. I heard Scott opening closet doors, moving furniture, checking under the bed. His search was getting frantic, movements quick and sharp. \"He's not here,\" Scott announced when he emerged from the second room. \"Not anywhere up here.\" We regrouped in the upstairs hallway, four of us when there should have been five. Jackson had simply vanished without making any sound, without leaving any trace of where he'd gone. People didn't just disappear like that, not without doors slamming or floorboards creaking or voices calling out. \"The blocked room downstairs,\" Curtis said. \"Maybe he's in there.\"We went back down, but Douglas had already tried that door. Still wouldn't open more than an inch. I put my ear against the gap and listened. No sound from the other side. No movement, no breathing, no voice asking for help. \"Jackson,\" I called through the crack. My voice echoed in what sounded like an empty room. If Jackson was in there, he wasn't answering. Douglas stepped back from the door and looked at the rest of us. \"We need to search outside. Maybe he went out the back.\" But that didn't make sense either. We would've heard the door open, would've heard his footsteps on the porch. Jackson wasn't the type to wander off without saying anything. He liked attention, liked being the center of conversation. Disappearing silently wasn't his style. Still, we had to check. Douglas led us back through the living room to the kitchen Scott had searched. A backdoor led onto a small porch overlooking what should've been forest. Instead, I saw the backyard from Jackson's house again. Same vegetable garden his mother tended, same tool shed his father had built, same apple tree with the rope swing hanging from the lowest branch. Douglas stepped outside and I followed. The porch boards were solid under our feet. No sagging or weakness like the front porch. We walked around the entire house, checking every side, every corner, every place someone could hide or take shelter. No Jackson. No footprints in the soft earth around the foundation. No sign anyone had been outside the house at all. \"This doesn't make sense,\" Curtis said when we completed the circuit. People don't just disappear. But Jackson had. Somewhere between walking through the front door and now, he'd vanished completely. No trace, no sound, no explanation. Douglas stood at the front corner of the house looking out toward the tree line where we'd emerged from the forest. \"I'm going to check the perimeter again. Make sure he didn't wander back toward the woods.\" He walked away from the house, moving in widening circles, checking behind trees and rocks, and anything large enough to conceal a person. I watched him work his way systematically through the clearing, calling Jackson's name every few steps. I stayed near the front porch with Scott and Curtis. The house loomed behind us, that open door like a mouth waiting to swallow the rest of us too. Whatever had happened to Jackson, it had happened fast and quiet. Too fast for him to call out, too quiet for us to hear. The clock inside continued its slow ticking, half a beat behind where it should be. The sound drifted through the open door, marking time that felt wrong, counting seconds that didn't match the rhythm of my own heartbeat. Douglas completed his search and walked back toward us. \"Nothing,\" he announced when he got close enough. \"No sign of him anywhere out here.\" We stood together in front of the house, four instead of five, trying to make sense of something that had no sense to it. Jackson was gone. Simply gone. Like he'd never been with us at all. That's when we heard footsteps coming from inside the house. The footsteps inside the house stopped. Then I heard the floorboards creak near the front door and Jackson stepped out onto the porch. He looked exactly like Jackson. Same dark hair, same round face with the dimpled cheeks, same clothes he'd been wearing when he disappeared. But something was wrong with his shirt. The fabric clung to his chest and shoulders, darker in places where water had soaked through. Damp patches spread across the cotton in irregular shapes as if he'd been caught in rain or had water poured over him. The strange thing was his face was completely dry. His hair showed no moisture, just the shirt wet in those odd patterns. \"Where were you?\" Douglas asked, his voice tight. Jackson stepped down from the porch with that same measured pace I had noticed before we entered the house. No bounce in his step, no quick movements. Everything controlled and even. \"I went upstairs to look around,\" Jackson said. His voice sounded normal but the words came out too evenly spaced. \"I watched from the railings as you all left the house. I saw you searching outside.\" I stared at him. We'd searched upstairs. Scott had gone through both bedrooms thoroughly. We'd called his name multiple times. The house wasn't that big. There was nowhere to hide up there that we wouldn't have found him. \"We looked upstairs,\" Scott said. \"You weren't there.\" Jackson shrugged, a movement that seemed practiced rather than natural. \"I must've been in the other room when you checked mine.\" But that didn't make sense either. We'd been calling for him. Even if he'd somehow missed us searching the bedrooms, he would've heard us shouting his name. And Scott had been thorough. He'd checked under the bed, behind the dresser, everywhere a person could possibly hide. I watched Jackson's hands as he spoke. They hung at his sides, completely still. No fidgeting, no movement at all. I realized I hadn't seen him do his usual thumb to knuckle rub since we'd been in the forest. Jackson always did that when he was nervous or thinking. It was such a constant habit that I'd stopped noticing it most of the time. But now in a situation that should've had him nervous as hell, his hands remained perfectly motionless. \"We should get back to shore,\" Douglas said. \"Find a way across the river.\" Jackson nodded once, a single precise movement. \"Yes, we should go.\"The way he said it bothered me. Not the words themselves, but the tone. No relief, no eagerness to leave this place, just agreement delivered in that same measured cadence. Curtis pushed his glasses up his nose for what had to be the 20th time since we'd arrived at this house. His hands were still shaking. \"I want to go home,\" he said again, his voice barely above a whisper. \"We all do,\" I said, though I kept watching Jackson. Everything about him looked right on the surface, but the longer I observed, the more wrong details I noticed. The way he stood was too perfect, no weight shifting from foot to foot, no minor adjustments for balance. Even when people try to stand still, they make tiny movements. Jackson wasn't making any. Douglas started walking toward the tree line, and we followed. The same order as before. Douglas leading, then Scott, then Curtis still cleaning his glasses obsessively, then Jackson with that unnaturally even pace, and me bringing up the rear. But this time, I found myself watching Jackson's back instead of checking behind us for threats. The forest felt different as we moved through it. The trees still had that wrong bark texture, like damp cloth instead of wood. And the ground still felt loose and unstable under our feet. But now there was something else, a sense of being watched that hadn't been there before. Not by the tall woman or the duplicates we'd seen earlier, but by the forest itself. The branches hanging too low, the shadows falling in patterns that didn't match the light, the sweet rot smell that seemed to follow us no matter which direction we walked. Jackson moved through it all without any sign of discomfort. He didn't duck under the low-hanging branches that the rest of us had to avoid. He didn't seem to notice the cloth-bark sensation when his hands brushed against tree trunks. He just walked, maintaining that steady pace, never stumbling on the loose ground that made the rest of us constantly adjust our footing. I tried to remember exactly how Jackson had been acting before he disappeared in the house. He'd been different then too, hadn't he? Less talkative than usual, more focused. But I'd attributed that to the strangeness of everything we'd encountered. Now, I wondered if the change had started earlier. We pushed through the hanging branches and emerged into the smaller clearing where we'd first heard the door opening. The massive fallen trunk was still there, covered in moss with those moisture veins running through it. Douglas didn't stop this time. He kept walking toward the far side where the path continued down the hillside. The light was dimming again, but differently than before. Instead of the unnatural shadow deepening we'd experienced earlier, this felt like actual evening approaching. The sky visible through the canopy had taken on a copper tint that suggested dusk was coming. How long had we been in that house? It felt like minutes, but time seemed unreliable in this place. As we descended the hillside path, I stayed close to Scott. He'd been quiet since we'd found Jackson, but his silence felt normal. The kind of thoughtful quiet that comes from processing too much strangeness too quickly. Curtis and Jackson walked behind us, Curtis still muttering under his breath about wanting to go home. Jackson saying nothing at all. The path wound down through the trees in those same deliberate switchbacks we'd climbed earlier. But something felt different about the route. The turns seemed to come at slightly different intervals, and I could swear some of the trees we passed looked familiar in a way that didn't make sense. We'd only been up this path once before, a few hours ago. I shouldn't be recognizing specific trees well enough to notice if they were in wrong positions, but there was that gnarled oak with the split trunk. I remembered it from our climb up because of the way the split created a narrow window between the two halves. Except now, it was on the left side of the path instead of the right. And that cluster of birch trees with the white bark, those had been farther down the hill before, near where we'd first started climbing. Now, they were closer to the top. I was about to say something to Scott when a voice cut through the air behind us. The sound scraped out of a throat that seemed unused to speech. Words formed by vocal cords that moved wrong. Raw and raspy like someone who'd been screaming for hours and then tried to talk. But the words themselves were clear enough. \"Where are you going?\" We all turned. The tall woman stood on the path about 50 feet uphill from us. Same impossibly thin frame, same long black hair, same pale skin and dark dress. But this time, she wasn't motionless. Her head moved as she looked at each of us in turn, and her mouth worked as if she was preparing to speak again. \"Run,\" Douglas shouted. I sprinted down the path with the others. My feet hit the loose ground and slid, sending small stones skittering ahead of me. Scott was beside me breathing hard, his face pale but determined. I could hear Curtis behind us, his breath coming in short gasps. But the path wasn't right. The switchbacks came too quickly, doubling back on themselves in patterns that hadn't been there before. Trees repeated, the same oak with the split trunk appeared three times, always on the wrong side of the path. The cluster of birch trees showed up twice in positions that made no geometric sense. The path twisted left when it should have gone right, then curved back on itself in a spiral that led us past the same boulder four times.We were running hard, covering distance, but the forest around us kept rearranging itself. Familiar landmarks appeared and reappeared in impossible configurations. I grabbed Scott's arm and pulled him to a stop. \"This isn't working,\" I said breathing hard. \"The path is wrong.\" Douglas had stopped too, looking around with a grim expression. \"The trees keep changing position.\" Curtis caught up to us. His glasses fogged again, his breathing ragged. \"Where's Jackson?\" I turned around. The path behind us was empty. Jackson wasn't there. \"He was right behind us,\" Curtis said, his voice rising toward panic. \"He was right there when we started running.\" Douglas cupped his hands around his mouth. \"Jackson?\" No answer. Just the rustling of leaves that move too readily in the minimal wind. \"We have to keep going,\" Douglas said. \"Find the shore.\" \"What about Jackson?\" Curtis asked. \"He'll have to find his own way,\" Douglas said, but his voice was tight with worry. We started moving again, but more carefully this time. Instead of following the path that kept changing, Douglas led us straight downhill through the trees. The slope was steep and the ground treacherous, but at least we were making consistent progress in one direction. The bark cloth sensation was everywhere now. Every tree trunk we grabbed for balance felt wrong under our hands. The sweet rot smell had intensified, mixing with that iron and mildew scent, until the air itself seemed thick and unpleasant. But we were definitely descending. I could feel the grade of the hillside pulling us downward, and gradually the trees began to thin. The copper light filtering through the canopy grew brighter, suggesting we were approaching the edge of the forest. Then I heard water, the sound of small waves lapping against wooden posts and stone. We pushed through the last line of trees and emerged onto what should have been East March shore. But this wasn't the rocky bank where we'd hauled ourselves out of the ford earlier. This was a proper dock. Wooden planks extending out over dark water with mooring posts and cleats for tying boats. The structure looked old and weathered, with several planks warped or missing entirely. At the far end, a narrow ferry was tied to a post with thick rope. The dock tilted at an angle that suggested part of the support structure underneath had given way. The planks sagged toward the water on the left side, and I could see gaps where the wood had rotted through completely. But it was still functional. The ferry bobbed gently at its mooring, apparently seaworthy despite its age. \"There,\" Douglas said, pointing at the ferry. \"That's our way across.\" Scott squinted at the boat. \"Looks like it might sink before we reach the other side.\" \"It's what we have,\" Douglas said. We started walking out onto the dock. The planks creaked under our weight, and I could feel the whole structure sway slightly with each step. The ferry was maybe 20 feet long and 6 feet wide, with bench seats along both sides and a single set of oars resting across the center. I was about to step onto the ferry when Scott grabbed my arm. \"Wait,\" he said. \"Where's Curtis?\" I turned around. Scott and Douglas were with me on the dock, but Curtis wasn't there. \"He was right behind us,\" Scott said, his voice tight with the same panic he'd shown when we'd lost Jackson. Douglas called out, \"Curtis?\" No answer from the tree line, just the sound of water lapping against the dock posts and the creak of old wood settling. \"We can't keep losing people,\" Scott said. But before Douglas could respond, a scream tore through the air from somewhere in the trees, high-pitched and terrified, cutting off abruptly after just a few seconds. Then the tall woman emerged from the forest. She walked with that same impossible straightness. Her spine too rigid and her shoulders too square. But this time, she wasn't alone. She carried Curtis in her arms, cradled against her chest like a mother holding her child. His head rested against her shoulder. His glasses askew, his eyes closed. His arms hung limp at his sides. The woman looked directly at us with that contradictory expression, mouth curved downward in a frown while her cheeks lifted upward and her eyes crinkled as if in joy. She stood at the edge of the trees holding Curtis and watched us with that impossible smile. Curtis wasn't giving up without a fight. His legs kicked against the woman's torso, heels drumming against her ribs in rapid succession. His hands clawed at her arms, fingers digging into the dark fabric of her dress, trying to find purchase on whatever lay beneath. The glasses had slipped completely off his face now, dangling from one ear by the thin wire frame. Even without them, he kept fighting with everything he had. The woman's grip adjusted around him, not violent, not sudden, just steady pressure, like someone readjusting their hold on a squirming child. Her arms tightened incrementally, drawing him closer against her chest. The contradictory expression never changed, that downward curve of her mouth paired with the lifted cheeks and crinkled eyes that suggested joy. The combination made my stomach twist. Curtis managed to get one arm free and swung it toward her face. His fist connected with her cheek, but she didn't flinch, didn't turn her head, didn't even blink.The blow landed with a dull sound, like hitting wet clay, and Curtis' hand bounced off without leaving any mark. She just kept watching us with those impossible features arranged in that wrong smile. Douglas had gone completely still beside me on the dock. Scott was making small choking sounds, like he couldn't get enough air. The ferry bobbed gently at the end of its mooring rope, creaking against the wooden posts. Water lapped at the dock supports with soft splashing sounds that seemed too normal for what we were witnessing. Curtis tried a different approach. Instead of hitting, he grabbed at the woman's hair, yanking hard enough that I could see the black strands stretching. She didn't react to that either. Her head didn't move. Her expression didn't shift. She just continued holding him while he pulled at her hair with both hands, his legs still kicking weakly against her sides. The woman's eyes stayed fixed on our group, not on Curtis, even though he was the one fighting in her arms. She watched us, studied us. The lifted cheeks quivered slightly, making the contradictory smile wobble, but the kind look in her eyes never cooled, never hardened. She looked at us like we were old friends she was happy to see again. Curtis was tiring. I could see it in the way his kicks were slowing down, becoming less coordinated. His breathing was getting ragged. The fight was going out of him by degrees, and there wasn't anything we could do about it. We were 50 feet away on a dock over water, and she was standing at the tree line holding our friend. The woman shifted her grip again. One arm moved higher, wrapping around Curtis' upper chest. The other dropped lower, supporting his back. The motion looked almost maternal, like she was trying to make him more comfortable. Curtis' struggles became more frantic in response. He must've sensed what I was starting to realize, that she wasn't trying to hurt him quickly. She was just going to hold him until he stopped fighting. Douglas took a step backward on the dock. The boards creaked under his weight, and the sound seemed to echo across the water. Scott was crying now, tears streaming down his face while he stared at Curtis and the woman. His hands were clenched into fists at his sides, but he wasn't moving toward shore. None of us were. That's when I heard it, a single crack, sharp and clean, like a thick branch breaking under too much weight. Curtis went limp. His arms dropped to his sides. His legs stopped kicking. His head fell back against the woman's shoulder, and his mouth opened slightly. The wire-rimmed glasses finally slipped completely off his ear, and hit the ground near the woman's feet with a tiny clink. The woman's expression didn't change. The downward mouth, the lifted cheeks, the crinkled eyes that looked so kind. She just stood there holding Curtis' lifeless body while we watched from the dock. Her grip adjusted one more time, cradling him like a mother holding a sleeping child. I moved without thinking. My body just reacted, stepping toward the shore before my brain caught up. But Douglas was already moving, too, stepping backward toward the ferry. His hand shot out and grabbed my arm, pulling me away from the edge of the dock. \"No,\" he said. Just that one word, but his voice carried absolute certainty. Scott sobbed something that might've been a curse. His whole body was shaking now, and he kept wiping at his face with the back of his hand. The tears weren't stopping. That's when I noticed Jackson. He was standing between Douglas and Scott, closer to the ferry than the rest of us. His posture was perfectly composed, hands at his sides, head tilted slightly as he watched the woman holding Curtis. And he was smiling. Not the woman's contradictory expression. Just a small, wrong little smile that didn't belong on his face while our friend was dead 50 feet away. The smile was too controlled, too deliberate. Jackson had never smiled like that in all the years I'd known him. Douglas was already moving toward the ferry, pulling me along by the arm he'd grabbed. Scott followed without being told, stumbling slightly on the warped dock boards. Jackson came last, still wearing that small smile, his movements unnaturally even and measured. We climbed into the ferry one by one. Douglas took the stern oars without discussion. Scott took the bow position. Jackson sat on the port-side bench. I settled onto the starboard bench, and immediately wrapped my arms around my knees, pulling them tight against my chest. Douglas untied the mooring rope and pushed us away from the dock with one oar. The ferry slid into the river current, leaving the damaged dock behind. Water gurgled around the hull as we picked up speed. Neither Douglas nor Scott spoke as they established their rowing rhythm. The oars cut through the water with steady splashing sounds. Douglas' stroke was powerful and controlled. Scott's was shakier, less coordinated, but he kept pace. The ferry moved across the dark water toward the West Vale shore. I hugged my knees tighter and watched the ripples spread out from our passage. The water was black in the growing dusk, reflecting nothing. Each stroke of the oars created new patterns on the surface, circular ripples that expanded outward before fading into the general movement of the current. Behind us, Eastmarch Slope was disappearing into shadow. The wrong buildings with their impossible angles became harder to distinguish as distance and darkness obscured the details.The forest where we'd found the house looked like any other tree line from the water. The dock where we'd left Curtis and the woman was already lost in the gloom. Ahead, Westvale appeared unchanged. The familiar buildings along the shore looked exactly as they had when we'd left that morning. Same angles, same proportions, same arrangement. The dock where we'd stolen the skiff was still there, though the skiff itself was gone, probably sunk somewhere downstream from the ford crossing. Douglas and Scott rowed without words. The only sounds were the splash of oars, the gurgle of water around the hull, and Scott's occasional sniffling. Jackson sat perfectly still on his bench, no longer smiling but maintaining that unnatural composure. His hands rested flat on his thighs. He didn't fidget, didn't shift his weight, didn't react to the rocking motion of the ferry. The crossing felt both endless and too short. Part of me wanted to stay on the water forever, suspended between what we'd left behind and what waited ahead. But another part just wanted to reach solid ground, to get away from the river that separated our world from that wrong place across the valley. Westvale shore grew larger as we approached. I could make out individual buildings now, the storehouse where we'd met to plan this expedition, the mill where Scott's father worked, the general store. All of it looked normal and familiar and completely unchanged by what we'd experienced. People were waiting on the shore, not just a few people, a crowd. 20 or 30 adults standing along the waterline watching our ferry approach. They weren't shouting, weren't calling out to us. They just stood there in the gathering dusk, waiting. Douglas and Scott pulled harder on the oars, bringing us in faster. The ferry's bow scraped against the rocky shore with a grinding sound. Hands reached out immediately, grabbing the sides of the boat, pulling us toward dry land. I recognized some of the faces. Mr. Henderson from the general store. Mrs. Carpenter who lived near the mill. Tom Bradley who worked at the quarry. They pulled me from the ferry without speaking. Their hands firm but not rough. Someone wrapped a blanket around my shoulders. The faces were counting. I could see it in their expressions as they looked from one of us to another. Douglas, Scott, Jackson, me. Four boys when five had left that morning. The absence was obvious and immediate. Curtis' mother was there. She stood a little apart from the others. Her hands pressed to her mouth. When she realized Curtis wasn't among us, the sound that came from her was sharp and shuddering. Not quite a scream, not quite a sob. Something between the two that cut through the evening air like broken glass. Curtis' father stood beside her but he didn't make any sound. He just stared past the shore, past our group, toward the dusk settling over the valley. His face was stone. His hands hung at his sides. He looked like a man trying to see something that was too far away to make out clearly. Other parents were there too. Douglas' mother reached for him with shaking hands. Scott's father pulled him into a fierce hug. They whispered questions we couldn't answer and comfort we couldn't accept. Jackson's mother was the most desperate. She gripped Jackson's shoulders with both hands, staring into his face with wild disbelief. Her boy had come back. Her son was standing right there in front of her, solid and real and apparently unharmed. She kept touching his face, his hair, his arms, as if she couldn't quite believe he was actually there. Jackson submitted to her attention without reaction. He didn't hug her back, didn't speak, just stood there while she examined him with frantic relief, letting her touch him and move him and hold him like he was a doll instead of her son. The crowd began moving away from the shore, leading us up toward the main part of town. People walked on all sides of us, forming a protective circle that felt more like a guard detail. No one asked what had happened. No one demanded explanations. They just moved us away from the water, away from the view across the valley, back into Westvale proper. Curtis' parents walked at the edge of the group. His mother's sobs had quieted to irregular breathing. His father kept looking back toward the river. The ferry bobbed empty at the shore behind us, forgotten in the general movement away from the water. Soon, it would be just another piece of debris from whatever had happened to the five boys who'd crossed the valley that morning. Four boys had come back. Curtis Walker was gone. The crowd moved us steadily away from the water. Their bodies forming a protective barrier around the four of us who'd returned. I- I walked between Douglas and Scott, feeling the weight of adult hands on my shoulders, guiding me forward with gentle but insistent pressure. Behind me, I could hear Mrs. Reyes still touching Jackson, her fingers running through his hair, across his cheeks, checking him over and over as if she couldn't quite believe he was real. \"My boy,\" she kept whispering. \"My boy, my boy.\" Jackson said nothing. That should've been the first sign, really. The Jackson I knew would've been cracking jokes by now, making light of the whole situation, telling some elaborate story about our adventure that was half truth and half fiction. He'd be grinning and gesturing, trying to make his mother laugh through her tears. Instead, he walked in perfect silence.... we reached the main road that led back into West Vale proper, and someone, I think it was Mr. Henderson, cleared his throat and spoke to the group. \"Boys had themselves quite an adventure,\" he said, his voice carrying that careful tone adults used when they were choosing their words deliberately. \"Took a boat across the valley, got themselves turned around, spent the day lost in the woods on the other side. Lucky they found their way back to the water before dark.\" I opened my mouth to correct him, to explain what we'd actually seen. But Douglas caught my eye and shook his head once, a sharp definitive movement that told me to stay quiet. Scott was still crying softly, his shoulders shaking. His father had one arm around him, murmuring something I couldn't hear. \"Course boys that age,\" Mr. Henderson continued, \"they get ideas, think they're ready for anything. Sometimes they bite off more than they can chew.\" Mrs. Walker made another of those terrible sounds, somewhere between a sob and a scream. Her husband put his arm around her, but his eyes stayed fixed on the dark water behind us. \"Curtis,\" she managed to say. \"Where's Curtis?\" The crowd went very still. I felt the hands on my shoulders tighten slightly. \"Curtis didn't make it back,\" Mr. Henderson said quietly. \"Sometimes the river takes what it wants.\" \"No.\" The word came out of me before I could stop it. \"No. That's not what happened. He didn't drown. The woman took him. The tall woman in the forest. She killed him.\" The silence that followed felt like a physical weight pressing down on all of us. I looked around at the faces surrounding me, neighbors I'd known my entire life, people who'd watched me grow up, who'd given me candy at harvest festivals and helped my father fix our roof after the big storm two years ago. They looked right through me, not with anger or disbelief, but as if I hadn't spoken at all, as if the words had never left my mouth. \"Jerry,\" my mother said softly, appearing at my side. \"You're in shock, sweetheart. You've had a terrible day.\" \"I'm not in shock,\" I said, louder this time. \"I'm telling you what happened. There were duplicates of us, perfect copies, and the woman with the long neck who screamed, and the house that shouldn't exist, and Curtis fought her but she broke his neck and...\" \"Jerry.\" My father's voice cut through my words like a blade. \"That's enough.\" I stared at him. My own father looking at me with the same expression I'd seen on every adult face since we'd returned. Not confusion or concern about what I was saying, just nothing. Complete deliberate blankness. \"Douglas,\" I said, turning to him desperately. \"Tell them. Tell them what we saw.\" Douglas met my eyes for a moment and I saw something there, fear maybe, or resignation. Douglas met my eyes for a moment and I saw something there, fear maybe, or resignation. Then he looked away and said nothing. \"Scott,\" I tried. \"You were there. You saw the duplicates under the trees. You heard the woman scream.\" Scott wiped his nose with the back of his hand and shook his head. \"I don't know what you're talking about, Jerry. We got lost in the woods. That's all.\" My stomach dropped. Scott's voice carried the same careful emptiness I'd heard from Mr. Henderson, the same deliberate blankness my parents were showing me. But Scott had been sobbing just minutes ago when the woman killed Curtis. I'd seen his tears, heard him choking back sobs as we rowed across the dark water. \"You're lying,\" I said. \"You cried when she broke his neck. You were shaking and crying and...\" \"Jerry, stop.\" My mother's hand found my arm, her grip firm but gentle. \"You're upsetting yourself. And you're upsetting the Walkers.\" I looked over at Curtis' parents. His mother had her face buried in her hands, her whole body shaking with grief. His father stood rigid beside her, staring back toward the river with an expression I couldn't read. \"Mrs. Walker,\" I said, stepping toward them. \"I'm sorry about Curtis. I'm so sorry. But he didn't drown. The woman took him. If we could organize a search party, maybe we could...\" Curtis' father turned to look at me then, and the expression on his face made me stop mid-sentence. It wasn't grief or anger or even confusion. It was warning, pure cold warning. \"My son drowned,\" he said quietly. \"He went across the river with you boys and he drowned. That's what happened.\" The finality in his voice hit me like a physical blow. This wasn't denial or shock or even hope. This was a decision, a choice to accept one version of events and reject any other. I felt something cold spreading through my chest, a realization that was worse than anything we'd encountered on the other side of the valley. The adults weren't confused or in shock. They weren't struggling to understand what had happened to us. They already knew. Maybe not the specific details, maybe not the exact sequence of events, but they knew something terrible waited across the water. They knew boys sometimes came back different. They knew sometimes boys didn't come back at all, and they decided long ago how to handle it. \"Jackson,\" I said, turning to him with desperate hope. \"Tell them. You were there. You saw everything I saw.\"... Jackson looked at me with those same empty eyes I'd been noticing since he'd emerged from the house. His mouth curved upward in what should have been a smile, but the expression was wrong. Too wide, too flat. The corners of his mouth pulled down even as his cheeks lifted, creating that same contradictory expression I'd seen on the tall woman's face. \"I don't know what you mean, Jerry,\" he said in that measured emotionless tone. \"We got lost in the woods. Curtis fell in the river. That's all that happened.\" But then he did something that made my blood freeze. He started to laugh. It began as a quiet chuckle, but it grew louder and more uncontrolled with each breath, a wild inappropriate sound that cut through the evening air like broken glass. His mother stepped back from him. Her hands falling away from his face. \"Jackson,\" she said uncertainly. \"It's funny,\" Jackson said between bursts of laughter. \"You're all holding me like I'm your dead son.\" The laughter stopped abruptly. Complete silence fell over the group. Jackson's smile remained frozen on his face, but his eyes filled with something heavy and dark. Grief maybe or something that looked like grief, but felt wrong like it was coming from somewhere else entirely. \"Jackson,\" his mother whispered. Several of the men stepped forward then. Douglas's uncle, Scott's father, Mr. Bradley from the hardware store. Their movements were smooth and coordinated like they'd done this before, like they'd been waiting for exactly this moment. Jackson offered no resistance as they gripped his sleeves and collar. He didn't struggle or protest or even seem surprised. He just looked at his mother one final time, and I saw something in that look that made my throat close up. Recognition maybe or goodbye. The men walked him steadily toward the water. I started to move to follow them, to do something, but my father's hand clamped down on my shoulder with iron strength. \"Don't,\" he said quietly. \"Don't watch.\" But I couldn't look away. I watched as they led Jackson to the river's edge where the ferry still bobbed empty against the rocky shore. I watched as they walked him into the shallow water, their boots splashing against the stones. Jackson went willingly. He didn't fight or beg or even speak. He just walked into the current with the men holding his arms. His face still wearing that wrong smile. The water reached his waist, then his chest. The men's grip on him shifted, became more gentle somehow, almost ceremonial. Then they let go. Jackson disappeared beneath the surface without a sound. The water swelled briefly where he'd been, then stilled. The men stood in the shallows for a moment longer watching the dark current, then turned and walked back to shore. Mrs. Reyes made a sound I'd never heard before, a keening wail that seemed to come from somewhere deeper than her throat. Her husband caught her as her legs gave out, and she collapsed against his chest. But she didn't protest. She didn't demand they bring him back or search for him or explain what they'd just done. She just cried, and her husband held her. And the rest of the adults stood in respectful silence. I stood there watching the water where Jackson had vanished, trying to process what I'd just witnessed. Had that really been Jackson? The friend I'd grown up with who told me elaborate lies about runaway chickens and made me laugh until my sides hurt? Or had it been something else wearing his face? Something that had taken his place in the house while we weren't looking? And if it was something else, then where was the real Jackson? Was he still alive somewhere across the valley, trapped in that impossible house? Or had he died the moment his duplicate appeared? The worst part was the growing certainty that the thing wearing Jackson's face had believed it was Jackson, had felt confused and lost and grief-stricken because it thought it was a 16-year-old boy who just watched his friend die. The smile, the laughter, the wrong expressions, maybe those were just cracks in whatever spell or curse had created it. Moments when its true nature bled through, which meant we'd just drowned something that thought it was my friend. I turned to Douglas and Scott, desperate to share this realization with someone who would understand. But when I opened my mouth to speak, Douglas shook his head again, more firmly this time. \"We need to organize a search party,\" I said instead, raising my voice so the adults could hear me. \"Curtis might still be alive. And Jackson, the real Jackson, he might be trapped over there. We have to go back.\" The adults continued their respectful silence. Not ignoring me exactly, but not acknowledging my words either, as if I was speaking a language they couldn't understand. \"Douglas,\" I said, \"Scott, help me explain. Tell them we have to go back.\" Douglas looked at me with tired eyes. \"There's nothing to go back for, Jerry. Curtis...\" I woke to silence. Not the usual morning quiet where birds chirped outside my window and distant voices carried from the street, but complete absence of sound. Even the house itself seemed to hold its breath around me. The events from yesterday crashed back immediately. Curtis was dead.... Jackson was gone. The tall woman with her impossible neck and contradictory smile, the house that shouldn't exist, the duplicate standing motionless under the trees. My stomach twisted as I remembered Douglas's tired eyes telling me there was nothing to go back for. I dressed slowly, my hands shaking as I pulled on the same clothes I'd worn three days ago when this all started. Everything felt different now. The fabric against my skin, the weight of my shoes, the way my bedroom looked in the morning light. Nothing had actually changed, but I couldn't see any of it the same way. Downstairs, my parents sat at the kitchen table with their coffee and newspaper, the picture of normalcy. My mother looked up when I entered. \"Good morning, Jerry. How did you sleep?\" Her voice carried no weight, no acknowledgement of what had happened yesterday. No concern about the fact that I'd watched Curtis die and seen Jackson dragged into the river. She spoke to me the same way she always had. \"Fine,\" I said, though my voice came out rough. My father turned a page of his newspaper without looking at me. The headlines were about grain prices and weather patterns, normal things, safe things, nothing about missing children or expeditions across the valley. I sat down at the table and my mother placed a plate of eggs and toast in front of me. The food looked exactly like it always did, but I couldn't make myself eat. Every time I lifted the fork, I saw Curtis's glasses falling to the ground after that sharp crack. \"Eat up,\" my mother said. \"You'll need your strength for school.\" School, as if nothing had happened. As if Curtis wouldn't be absent from his desk today because he was dead on the other side of the valley. I forced myself to take a few bites, chewing mechanically. The eggs tasted like nothing. My parents continued their quiet morning routine around me, discussing plans for the day and commenting on articles in the newspaper. Neither of them mentioned yesterday. Neither of them asked about Curtis or Jackson or what we'd seen across the water. After breakfast, I walked through Westvale toward the schoolhouse. The streets looked exactly the same as they always had, but something fundamental had shifted. I passed Mrs. Henderson hanging laundry on her line. She smiled and waved at me like she did every morning. No acknowledgement that her husband had been part of the crowd that pulled us from the ferry yesterday. At Miller's Corner, I saw Tom Bradley loading supplies into his cart. He nodded at me in passing, the same casual greeting he'd always given. No sign that he'd been one of the men who walked Jackson into the river and held him under until he drowned. The schoolhouse sat at the end of Maple Street. Its red brick walls and white trim exactly as familiar as always. Children were already gathering in the yard, talking and laughing in their usual morning groups. I searched their faces for any sign that they knew what had happened, but found nothing. They looked at me the same way they always had. Douglas stood near the front steps, talking with Mary Fletcher about something that made her laugh. His posture was relaxed, his expression easy. No trace of the exhaustion and horror I'd seen in his eyes yesterday. When he noticed me approaching, he smiled. \"Morning, Jerry. Ready for Henderson's arithmetic test?\" I stared at him. This was Douglas who had led us across the valley, who had seen the duplicates and the tall woman, who had rowed us back across the dark water after watching Curtis die. Now, he stood here asking about arithmetic tests. \"Douglas,\" I said carefully, \"do you remember yesterday?\" His smile didn't waver. \"Yesterday? Helped my father with the fence repairs. Why?\" \"The expedition, crossing to Eastmarch, Curtis and Jackson.\" Douglas tilted his head slightly, the way people do when they hear something that doesn't make sense to them. \"Curtis and Jackson, what about them?\" \"They're gone, Douglas. Curtis is dead. Jackson drowned in the river.\" Mary Fletcher looked between us with growing confusion. Douglas' expression shifted to concern, but not the kind of concern I expected. It was the look adults gave when they thought a child was having strange fantasies. \"Jerry, what are you talking about? Curtis moved away last month with his family. His father got work in Millbrook, and Jackson...\" Douglas paused, his brow furrowing as if trying to remember something difficult. \"Jackson's family decided to try their luck in the Eastern settlements. They left about the same time.\" The words hit me like a physical blow. I looked at Mary, hoping to see some flicker of recognition, some sign that she remembered our classmates differently, but her expression matched Douglas' perfectly. \"That's right,\" she said. \"Curtis was so excited about the move. Said Millbrook had a real library with hundreds of books.\" My throat felt tight. \"No, that's not what happened. We went across the valley yesterday morning. All five of us, we took the ferry and crossed to Eastmarch and Curtis died there.\" Douglas reached out and put a hand on my shoulder, the way you might comfort someone who was clearly unwell. \"Jerry, we've never been across the valley. Nobody goes to Eastmarch, you know that.\" \"But we did go. You led us there. You said we needed to see what was really over there.\"\"I would never suggest something like that,\" Douglas said, and his voice carried absolute conviction. \"It's dangerous across the valley. Everyone knows that.\" Scott appeared from around the corner of the schoolhouse, his face bright and cheerful. No trace of the tears I'd seen him crying yesterday. No sign of the fear that had made his hands shake as we rode back across the dark water. \"What's dangerous?\" Scott asked, joining our group. \"Jeri thinks we went to Eastmarch yesterday,\" Mary said with a small laugh. Scott's expression shifted to the same concerned confusion I'd seen from Douglas. \"Eastmarch? Why would we go there? Nobody goes to Eastmarch.\" I looked at Scott carefully, searching his face for any crack in this performance. But it wasn't a performance. His confusion was genuine. His concern for my apparent delusion was real. \"Scott, you were there. You cried when Curtis died. You saw the tall woman carry his body.\" Scott shook his head slowly. \"Jeri, I think you might've had a bad dream. Curtis moved to Millbrook, remember? His family packed up their wagon and everything.\" The school bell rang, calling us inside. Douglas, Scott, and Mary headed toward the door, still throwing worried glances back at me. I stood frozen in the yard, watching them go. Inside the schoolhouse, I took my usual seat and looked around the room. Curtis's desk sat empty in the third row, just as it had for the past month since his family moved to Millbrook. Jackson's seat was vacant too, had been since his family departed for the Eastern Settlements. Except that wasn't what had happened. Curtis hadn't moved to Millbrook. His family hadn't packed a wagon. Curtis had died in the arms of a creature that shouldn't exist, on the other side of a valley that no one was supposed to cross. But everyone else remembered it differently. Everyone else had the same false memories, the same convenient explanations for why Curtis and Jackson were no longer here. Mr. Henderson began the day's lessons, his voice carrying the same authority it always had. When he called roll, he skipped over Curtis's name and Jackson's name without pause, without acknowledgement that they had ever existed in this classroom. During the arithmetic lesson, I found myself staring out the window toward the valley. From this angle, I could just see the edge of the dark water through the trees. Eastmarch lay beyond that water, hidden by distance and morning haze. The tall woman was still there, probably still holding Curtis's body. The house still stood in its impossible clearing, with its reversed photographs and backwards clock. But according to everyone else in Westvale, none of that had ever happened. At recess, I approached other classmates, testing their memories. Sarah Mills remembered Curtis being excited about his family's move to Millbrook. Tom Baker recalled helping Jackson's family load their wagon for the journey east. Every detail was consistent, every story perfectly aligned. They weren't lying. They genuinely remembered these false events as if they had really happened. Somehow, Westvale had rewritten its own history to explain the absence of Curtis and Jackson without acknowledging what had really occurred. I walked to the edge of the schoolyard and looked toward the valley again. The water stretched dark and still between the hills, just as it always had. But now I understood something that no one else seemed to remember. That water wasn't just a boundary between two settlements. It was a barrier between two different kinds of reality. The town had restored its unspoken rule about never looking toward Eastmarch, but the rule went deeper than I'd realized. It wasn't just about not looking. It was about not remembering, not acknowledging, not allowing the truth of what existed across that water to take root in Westvale's collective memory. I thought about the adults who had been waiting for us at the shore yesterday. They hadn't seemed surprised to see us return. They'd known exactly how to handle the situation. They'd had a story ready, a way to explain away what had happened. This wasn't the first time children had crossed the valley. This wasn't the first time some of them hadn't come back. The valley watched back. I could feel it even now, standing in the schoolyard with my back to the water. Something patient and malevolent waited across that dark expanse, something that had taken Curtis and Jackson and who knows how many others over the years. But Westvale had found a way to survive alongside that presence, by forgetting, by rewriting history, by refusing to acknowledge what really happened to the children who satisfied their curiosity about what lay beyond the water. Everyone except me. For some reason, I still remembered. I still carried the weight of what we'd witnessed over there, the tall woman's impossible neck stretching toward us, the duplicate standing motionless under the trees, the house that shouldn't exist, Curtis's glasses falling to the ground. I was the only one who knew the truth about what waited across the dark water, the only one who understood why Westvale enforced its silent prohibition with such rigid determination. Some boundaries existed for protection. Some curiosities demanded prices too terrible to pay. The town had learned this lesson long ago and had developed ways to forget each time the lesson needed to be taught again. But I couldn't forget. I couldn't erase the tall woman's downward smile or the way Jackson's replacement had moved with unnatural wrongness. These memories belonged to me now, and I would carry them alone. I accepted my role as the sole keeper of this terrible knowledge, understanding that I would live each day with the crushing weight of what I had witnessed and somehow survived."
