  "full_text": "I stared at my kitchen calendar, my eyes fixed on the weekend circled in bright red marker. The bold circle sat there like a warning sign, counting down the days until I'd be dragged into the wilderness. Nancy had marked it with little stars and a crescent moon doodle. Her excitement visible in the heavy pen strokes that had nearly torn through the paper. \"It's just two nights,\" I muttered to myself, taking a sip of coffee that had already gone cold. Two nights of sleeping on the ground, two nights of whatever crawled, slithered, or prowled through Blackwood National Forest. Two nights without a proper bathroom. But I loved Nancy. That was the simple truth that had me packing a backpack instead of making excuses. In the year we'd been dating, I'd learned that her passion for the outdoors was as much a part of her as her laugh, or the way she tucked her hair behind her ear when she was thinking. Nancy had been talking about this trip for weeks. \"Jake, it's a blood moon weekend,\" she'd said. Her amber eyes lighting up the way they always did when she talked about celestial events. \"We can't miss it. The forest under a blood moon, it'll be magical.\" Magic wasn't exactly what I was worried about. Ticks, poison ivy, and bears seemed more likely. The morning of our departure came too quickly. Nancy arrived at my apartment with her truck already loaded with gear, wearing a smile that made it impossible to back out. \"Ready for an adventure?\" she asked, kissing me on the cheek as she walked past me into my apartment to grab my backpack. \"As ready as I'll ever be,\" I said, forcing enthusiasm I didn't feel. I locked my apartment door behind us, each click of the deadbolt feeling like a farewell to safety and indoor plumbing. The drive to Blackwood took three hours, winding through increasingly remote areas until even the radio stations turned to static. I gripped the steering wheel tightly as the road narrowed and twisted up the mountain, focusing all my attention on not driving us off a cliff. Nancy meanwhile, seemed completely at ease. Her feet propped on the dashboard as she pointed out landmarks and talked about what we might see in the night sky. \"The blood moon happens during a total lunar eclipse,\" she explained, her fingers tracing invisible patterns in the air. \"The Earth's shadow falls across the moon, but some sunlight still filters through our atmosphere. All the blue light gets scattered away, leaving only the red light to reach the moon.\" I nodded, only half listening as I navigated a particularly sharp turn. \"Sounds pretty,\" I managed, braking more sharply than I intended when a deer bounded across the road ahead. \"It's more than pretty,\" Nancy continued, unfazed by our near miss with wildlife. \"Blood moons have cultural significance in almost every ancient civilization. Some saw it as an omen, others as a time when the barrier between worlds thins.\" \"That's comforting,\" I said dryly, earning a playful punch to my shoulder. We reached the trailhead around noon. The parking area was empty except for one dusty pickup truck at the far end. As I pulled into a spot, I noticed a weathered sign with a map of the forest trails and warnings about wildlife. Nancy was already unloading gear before I'd turned off the engine. She moved with practiced efficiency, sorting through equipment and distributing weight between packs. It was clear she'd done this countless times before. \"My dad taught me everything about camping,\" she said when she caught me watching her. Emmett could probably survive in the wilderness with just a pocketknife and his wits. We used to go camping at least once a month when I was growing up. I tried to imagine Nancy as a little girl learning to pitch a tent or start a fire under her father's watchful eye. The image made me smile despite my apprehension. \"Here,\" she said, handing me what looked like an enormous backpack. \"You take the tent and cooking gear. I've got the food and everything else.\" I nearly toppled over when I shouldered the pack. \"Jesus, Nancy. Are we camping or moving in?\" She laughed, adjusting the straps on my shoulders with expert hands. \"Trust me. You'll be glad we brought everything when you're warm and well-fed tonight.\" The trail started gently enough, a dirt path winding between tall pines. Nancy took the lead, moving with the sure-footed confidence of someone who belonged in these woods. I followed behind, already feeling sweat dampen my shirt under the weight of the pack. \"How much farther?\" I asked after what felt like hours of hiking uphill. Nancy checked her watch. \"We've only been walking for 45 minutes, city boy,\" she teased, \"but we've got another hour or so to go. I want to find the perfect spot before we lose the light.\" By the time Nancy finally stopped in a small clearing, my legs were burning and my shoulders ached from the pack. I dropped to the ground with a groan of relief while she surveyed the area with a critical eye. \"This is perfect,\" she declared, turning in a slow circle. \"Good tree coverage, flat ground for the tent, and an open view of the sky for when the moon rises.\" I looked around, trying to see what made this particular patch of forest floor better than any other we'd passed. The clearing was ringed by tall pines and a few deciduous trees I couldn't name. A fallen log lay at one edge, already being reclaimed by moss and fungi. As I caught my breath, something struck me as odd. I held perfectly still, listening. Nothing, absolutely nothing.\"Nancy,\" I said quietly, \"do you notice anything strange?\" She looked up from where she was already unpacking the tent. \"Strange how?\" \"It's completely silent. No birds, no insects, nothing.\" Nancy paused, tilting her head as if to listen better. Then she laughed, the sound jarringly loud in the quiet forest. \"Wildlife usually steers clear of human activity,\" she said, resuming her unpacking. \"They probably heard us coming from a mile away. Nothing to worry about.\" I nodded, accepting her explanation because she was the expert. But something about the silence felt wrong, oppressive even. In movies, animals going quiet was never a good sign. \"Come help me with the tent,\" Nancy called, interrupting my thoughts. \"I'll show you how to set it up properly.\" For the next hour, we worked on making our camp. Nancy taught me how to pitch the tent, finding the flattest ground and securing the stakes properly. She showed me how to hang our food bag from a tree branch to keep it away from bears, a thought that did nothing to ease my anxiety. As the afternoon wore on, I kept expecting the forest sounds to return, the chirp of birds, the buzz of insects, the rustle of small animals in the underbrush, but the silence persisted, broken only by our voices and movements. We finished setting up camp as the daylight began to fade. Nancy got a small camping stove going and started preparing dinner, some kind of pasta with dried vegetables that smelled surprisingly good after hours of physical exertion. \"See? Not so bad, right?\" Nancy asked, handing me a steaming bowl. \"The company makes it bearable,\" I admitted, which earned me a smile. We sat side by side on the fallen log, eating our dinner as darkness settled around us. But even as we talked quietly about mundane things, work, friends, plans for the coming week, I couldn't shake my uneasiness. The forest remained unnaturally quiet as if holding its breath. Every so often, I would pause in our conversation, straining to hear any natural sound from the woods around us. Nothing, not even the wind in the trees. \"You're still thinking about the silence, aren't you?\" Nancy asked, noticing my distraction. \"It just doesn't seem right,\" I said. \"Shouldn't we hear something? Anything?\" Nancy set her empty bowl aside and took my hand. \"Forests can be quiet, Jake, especially at dusk when diurnal animals are settling down and nocturnal ones haven't come out yet. It's normal.\" I wanted to believe her. I nodded and squeezed her hand, but the silence still felt wrong to me. It wasn't the peaceful quiet of nature at rest. It felt deliberate, watchful. As we cleaned up after dinner, storing everything carefully to avoid attracting animals, I kept glancing at the darkening woods around our little clearing. The trees seemed to press closer in the growing darkness, their shadows stretching toward our campsite like grasping fingers. \"You're going to love the blood moon,\" Nancy said oblivious to my discomfort as she checked her watch. \"It should be rising in a couple of hours. We'll have the perfect view right from our campsite.\" I forced a smile, not wanting to dampen her enthusiasm with my irrational unease. After all, she was the experienced one. If Nancy wasn't worried about the silence, maybe I was just being paranoid, my city instincts misreading the normal rhythms of the forest. But as night fully claimed the woods around us, the silence only seemed to deepen, becoming almost physical in its intensity. And despite Nancy's reassurances, I couldn't shake the feeling that something in the darkness was watching us, waiting with a patience I couldn't comprehend. I watched the blood moon rise above the tree line. The forest had been quiet all day, but now as darkness settled fully around us, that silence felt heavier, more intentional. The moon emerged slowly, a massive crimson disc that seemed too large, too close as it climbed into the night sky. \"Look at how the Earth's shadow is moving across it,\" Nancy said, pointing upward. \"The red color comes from sunlight passing through our atmosphere and bending around the Earth.\" I nodded, genuinely impressed despite the unease growing in my stomach. \"It's beautiful,\" I admitted. The red glow bathed everything around us, the trees, our tent, Nancy's face, in an unsettling crimson light that made familiar shapes seem alien. \"Ancient civilizations thought blood moons were omens,\" Nancy continued, her voice carrying easily in the stillness. \"The Mayans believed they signaled cosmic shifts. Some cultures thought they mark the boundary between our world and something else.\" I wish she hadn't added that last part. My mother, Judy, had filled my childhood with similar warnings, stories about things that lurked in the spaces between worlds, especially on nights when the moon turned red. I dismissed those tales as I grew up, but standing here under this blood-red sky, they suddenly felt less like superstition and more like forgotten wisdom. We sat on the fallen log, eating the granola bars and dried fruit we'd packed for a late snack, barely speaking. The oppressive quiet made normal conversation feel wrong somehow, intrusive. I caught myself whispering without knowing why.\"Why are we whispering?\" Nancy asked, also in a whisper. \"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"It just feels right.\" She nodded, understanding. The silence around us wasn't just the absence of sound. It felt like something actively listening. Around 10:00, we crawled into our tent and slipped into our sleeping bags. The ground beneath me was hard and uneven despite the sleeping pad Nancy had insisted I bring. I shifted positions a dozen times, trying to get comfortable while Nancy fell asleep almost immediately. I stared at the red-tinted ceiling of our tent, watching shadows from the trees move across it like grasping fingers. Eventually, exhaustion overcame discomfort, and I drifted off. My dreams were disturbing. Red light filtered through dense trees as I ran from something I couldn't see. Shadowy figures stood just beyond my vision, watching and waiting. My mother's voice echoed through the dreamscape, \"They hunt under the blood moon, Jake. They've been hunting since before we had names for them.\" In my dream, I was a child again, sitting on my bed while Mom checked under it for monsters. \"How do you know they're real?\" I asked her. \"Because I've seen them,\" she whispered, her eyes wide and serious. \"Under the blood moon, they look almost like us, but they move wrong, and they're hungry, Jake, so hungry.\" A sharp sound jolted me awake. I opened my eyes to the dark interior of the tent, momentarily disoriented. The red glow of the blood moon still filtered through the fabric, casting everything in dim crimson. I lay perfectly still, my heart pounding as I listened. There it was again, footsteps crunching softly on leaves outside our tent. The movement seemed too deliberate for a wild animal. Animals moved with purpose, seeking food or water, then moving on. These footsteps were exploratory, curious. I checked my watch, 2:00 in the morning. The footsteps continued circling our campsite. I nudged Nancy's shoulder gently. \"Nancy,\" I whispered, my voice barely audible. \"Wake up.\" She stirred, rolling toward me. \"What's wrong?\" she murmured, her voice thick with sleep. \"There's something outside,\" I whispered. \"Listen.\" We both went silent. The footsteps continued their slow circuit around our tent. \"It's just a deer,\" Nancy said after a moment, but she didn't sound convinced. \"Deer don't circle like that,\" I replied. \"They don't investigate.\" We lay still, listening, as the footsteps continued their methodical pattern. Whatever was out there circled our tent completely, then started another loop. The third time around, I began counting. By the 12th circuit, my mouth had gone dry with fear. Then the footsteps stopped directly in front of the tent entrance. The silence that followed was worse than the footsteps. I could feel Nancy's body tense beside me as we both stared at the zippered doorway, waiting. I stared in disbelief as Nancy suddenly reached for the zipper, pulling it down with deliberate movements. She didn't acknowledge my frantic whispers as she crawled outside, leaving me alone in the tent. The sound of the zipper seemed unnaturally loud against the backdrop of complete silence. \"Nancy,\" I whispered urgently. \"What are you doing? Come back.\" No response came, just the soft sound of her footsteps moving away from the tent. I waited, counting the minutes on my watch, hoping she just stepped out briefly to use the bathroom or check something. One minute passed, then three, then five. My anxiety grew with each passing second. This wasn't like Nancy at all. She was too experienced to wander off alone in the middle of the night. After waiting what felt like forever, I made up my mind. I had to follow her. I crawled toward the tent opening, my hands shaking as I pushed aside the flap. The sight that greeted me stole my breath. The blood moon hung directly overhead, massive and impossibly red. Its crimson light poured down through the trees, transforming our campsite into something from a nightmare. Every surface, the tent, the trees, my own hands was bathed in that sickly red glow. I stepped out fully, my eyes adjusting to the strange light. That's when I spotted her. Nancy stood about 20 feet from our tent, completely motionless. Her back was to me, her face tilted upward. She wore only the T-shirt and shorts she'd gone to sleep in, her feet bare against the forest floor. \"Nancy,\" I called, louder this time, no longer concerned about keeping quiet. Something was very wrong. She didn't move, didn't acknowledge me at all. I approached her slowly, repeatedly saying her name. \"Nancy. Nancy, can you hear me? What's going on?\" No matter how many times I called to her, she remained completely unresponsive. It was as if she couldn't hear me at all. The closer I got, the more unnerving the sight became. Her body was rigid, unnaturally still. When I finally reached her, I hesitated before touching her. Her face was blank, expressionless, her eyes wide open and staring upward. Those eyes, I'll never forget how they looked. They reflected the red moonlight like mirrors, giving her an otherworldly, almost inhuman appearance.\"Nancy, please,\" I said, reaching out to touch her shoulder. Her skin felt wrong under my fingers, cold and clammy despite the warm night air. It was like touching someone who'd been standing in a freezer. I followed her gaze upward, expecting to see that she was transfixed by the blood moon itself, but her focus wasn't on the moon at all. She was looking at something else, something in the forest beyond our campsite. I turned slowly following the direction of her stare, and that's when I saw it, or rather, her. There was a woman standing among the trees. She stood about 50 yards away, just close enough that I could make out her silhouette and some details, but far enough that her features remained indistinct in the shadows. She wore tattered, flowing clothes that moved and rippled despite the complete absence of wind. Her long hair hung in tangled strands around her face, which remained obscured in darkness. The woman was completely motionless, just like Nancy. But unlike Nancy, I could feel her awareness, her attention. She was watching us, watching me. I couldn't see her eyes, but I could feel them on me, studying us with an intensity that made my skin crawl. She made no move to approach, no gesture to communicate. She simply stood there, partially hidden among the trees, observing us with what felt like hungry interest. I wanted to run, to grab Nancy and drag her back to the safety of our tent, but I couldn't move. I couldn't even speak. We were caught in some kind of terrible tableau. Nancy staring at the woman, the woman staring back at us, and me frozen between them, the only one aware of how wrong this all was. The woman's clothes continued to move and flow around her body as if she were underwater. Her hair too seemed to drift and sway despite the still night air. Everything about her was wrong. Her stillness, her presence, the impossible movement of her garments. I couldn't see her face clearly, but something told me I didn't want to. Something told me that if I got close enough to make out her features, I'd regret it for the rest of my life. I reached for Nancy's arm, grabbing it more firmly than I'd ever held her before. My fingers wrapped around her cold skin as I tried pulling her back toward our tent. \"Nancy, we need to go now.\" My voice cracked barely above a whisper. She didn't respond. Her body remained rigid, eyes fixed on that woman at the forest's edge. When I tugged harder, Nancy resisted with a strength I didn't know she had. Her feet seemed planted to the ground, her body leaning slightly forward as if drawn by an invisible thread connecting her to the stranger. I pulled again, harder this time. \"Nancy, please. Something's wrong. We need to get back to the tent.\" The moonlight cast everything in that sickening red glow, making Nancy's blank expression look almost mask-like. She gave no indication she'd heard me at all. That's when I noticed movement from the corner of my eye. The woman had started to move. She didn't walk, not exactly. She glided between the trees with a fluid motion that made my stomach turn. Her feet, they didn't seem to touch the ground. Each step carried her sideways, then forward in a pattern that no human joints could manage. Yet she never stumbled, never paused. Her tattered clothes continued their underwater rippling despite the still air. I watched paralyzed as she began a wide arc around our campsite. She maintained her distance, never coming closer, but never retreating either. Her face remained hidden behind that curtain of tangled hair, but I knew I could feel her eyes on us, watching, studying. The realization hit me like ice water. She was hunting us, learning our movements, looking for weaknesses, testing Nancy's connection to whatever hold she had on her. My heart hammered against my ribs. This wasn't some random encounter. This was calculated, deliberate. \"Fuck this,\" I muttered, abandoning any pretense of gentle persuasion. I moved behind Nancy and wrapped both arms around her waist. Using every ounce of strength I had, I lifted her off the ground. She was surprisingly light, but she thrashed against me immediately, her arms flailing and legs kicking out. \"Nancy, stop, please,\" I grunted, struggling to maintain my grip. Her elbow caught me in the ribs, sending a sharp pain through my side, but I didn't let go. I half carried, half dragged her backward toward our tent, my eyes never leaving the woman who continued her unnatural circling. She turned her head to track our movement, that hidden face always pointed in our direction. Nancy's resistance was unlike anything I'd experienced from her before. Her normally gentle demeanor had transformed into something feral and desperate. She clawed at my arms, leaving red welts across my skin. The 10 yards back to our tent felt like a mile. My lungs burned from the effort and fear. When my back finally hit the tent fabric, I fumbled one hand behind me to find the zipper while keeping my other arm locked around Nancy's waist. I managed to get the tent flap open just enough. With one final surge of desperate strength, I pulled us both through the opening and onto our sleeping bags. Nancy immediately tried to scramble back toward the entrance, but I threw myself on top of her, using my weight to pin her down.I reached back and yanked the zipper closed with such force I thought it might break off in my hand. \"Nancy, stop. Please, stop,\" I begged, holding her against me. Her struggling continued for what felt like minutes, but was probably only seconds. Then, gradually, I felt the tension leave her body. The rigid posture softened. Her breathing, which had been shallow and rapid, deepened and slowed. I kept my arms around her, afraid to let go, my own breath coming in ragged gasps. We lay there on top of our sleeping bags, a tangle of limbs and fear. After a long moment, I felt Nancy shift. She turned her head, blinking slowly as if waking from a deep sleep. \"Jake?\" Her voice sounded normal again. Confused, but Nancy. \"Why are we awake? What's going on?\" I loosened my grip slightly, but didn't let go entirely. \"You don't remember?\" She pushed herself up to a sitting position, rubbing her eyes. \"Remember what? I was asleep.\" My hands shook as I sat up beside her. The red moonlight filtered through our tent, casting everything in that bloody glow. Outside, the forest had fallen silent again. \"Nancy, you... You walked out of the tent in the middle of the night. You just got up, unzipped the door, and walked out. I followed you and found you standing in the clearing, staring at...\" I swallowed hard. The image of the woman's unnatural movement fresh in my mind. \"At what?\" Nancy asked, looking genuinely confused. \"There was a woman in the woods, standing at the edge of the trees, watching us. And you were just... Staring at her, like you were in some kind of trance. When I tried to bring you back, you fought me.\" Nancy's brow furrowed. \"Jake, I don't remember any of that. The last thing I remember is falling asleep.\" \"But it happened. She was right there, wearing these tattered clothes that moved like they were under water. And she started circling our camp, watching us like... Like she was hunting us.\" Nancy reached out and took my hand. Her skin felt warm now, normal. \"Jake, listen to me. You probably had a nightmare, a really vivid one.\" \"It wasn't a dream,\" I insisted, my voice rising. \"I was awake the whole time. I saw her. I saw you standing there, looking at her with this blank expression. Your eyes were reflecting the moonlight, like... Like they weren't even your eyes.\" Nancy squeezed my hand. \"Think about it. We're in an unfamiliar place, sleeping on the ground. There's this weird silence in the forest that's been making you uneasy all day, and now there's this creepy red moon. Your brain probably took all that stress and turned it into a nightmare.\" \"But...\" \"It happens all the time,\" she continued. \"Stress and unfamiliar surroundings can cause really realistic dreams. Sometimes people even sleepwalk or think they're awake when they're not.\" I wanted to believe her. Part of me desperately wanted this to be a nightmare, something I could laugh about in the morning. But I knew what I'd seen. The woman's unnatural movements, Nancy's cold skin and vacant stare, the way she'd fought against me with strength that didn't seem like her own. \"It felt real,\" I said quietly. Nancy shifted closer, putting her arm around my shoulders. \"I know. And I'm not saying you're making it up. I'm just saying our brains can play tricks on us, especially in places like this.\" I looked toward the tent door, still zipped shut. Outside, there was nothing but silence, and that red glow seeping through the fabric. Had I imagined it all? The alternative, that something inhuman was circling our camp, that it had somehow taken control of Nancy, seemed too horrifying to accept. \"Maybe you're right,\" I said, not believing it, but wanting the comfort of a rational explanation. Nancy smiled softly. \"Let's try to get some sleep, okay? Everything will seem clearer in the morning.\" She lay back down on her sleeping bag, pulling me with her. I settled beside her, my body still tense, ears straining for any sound from outside. \"It just seemed so real,\" I whispered. \"That's how nightmares work,\" Nancy replied, her voice already growing drowsy. \"They convince you they're real until you wake up.\" I didn't argue further. But as Nancy's breathing evened out into sleep beside me, I kept my eyes open, staring at the tent ceiling, watching the shadows move across the red-tinted fabric. I couldn't shake the feeling that the woman was still out there, circling, waiting. And I couldn't forget the look in Nancy's eyes, empty and reflecting, like something else had been looking through them. I insisted I'd been fully awake and the woman was real, but Nancy's skepticism made me doubt myself. I lay rigid in my sleeping bag, straining to hear anything outside our tent while Nancy's breathing had already settled into the deep rhythm of sleep beside me. \"I know what I saw,\" I whispered to myself, though the words sounded hollow in the confines of our tent. The red moonlight still filtered through the thin fabric, casting everything in that unnatural crimson glow. I checked my watch, just past 3:00 in the morning. Hours until dawn,... my arms still stung from the welts Nancy's nails had left when I dragged her back to safety, physical evidence that something had happened regardless of what she claimed. Every few minutes, I'd freeze at what I thought was a sound outside, a twig snapping, fabric rustling, only to be met with that same oppressive silence that had unnerved me since we'd arrived. I kept my eyes locked on the tent zipper, half expecting it to slowly pull down on its own, revealing that woman's face with her tangled hair and flowing clothes. Nancy shifted in her sleep, mumbling something unintelligible before settling again. I envied her peace. How could she sleep so soundly after what happened? Or maybe nothing had happened to her. Maybe I really was losing my mind out here in the wilderness. I pulled my sleeping bag up higher, creating a barrier between myself and whatever might be lurking outside, though I knew the thin nylon offered no real protection. The hard ground beneath my sleeping pad seemed to grow more uncomfortable with each passing hour, every root and stone making itself known against my back. Sometime during those endless hours, exhaustion must have overcome vigilance because I startled awake to Nancy moving around the tent. Sunlight, normal yellow sunlight, was streaming through the fabric. \"Morning,\" Nancy said cheerfully, already half-dressed in her hiking clothes. \"You look terrible. Bad dreams?\" I sat up disoriented. \"What time is it?\" \"Almost 7:00. I was going to let you sleep a bit longer, but we should get moving if we want to make it back to the trailhead by noon.\" I rubbed my face, trying to process the normalcy of the morning against the strangeness of the night. Outside the tent, I could hear birds calling to each other, their songs overlapping in the morning chorus. Somewhere nearby, something small, a squirrel maybe, rustled through the underbrush. \"Do you hear that?\" I asked. Nancy paused while pulling on her sock. \"Hear what?\" \"The birds, the animals. Everything's making noise again.\" She looked at me strangely. \"Yeah. That's what happens in forests, Jake.\" \"But yesterday...\" I stopped myself. \"Never mind.\" I crawled out of my sleeping bag and found my clothes, changing quickly while Nancy stepped outside to take down the food bags she'd hung from the trees. The normal sounds of the forest were almost as unsettling as the silence had been, simply because of how abruptly they'd returned. When I emerged from the tent, the clearing looked completely different in the morning light. Dew sparkled on the grass and shafts of sunlight cut through the tree canopy. Nothing about this peaceful scene suggested the terrifying encounter from last night. Nancy was efficiently rolling up her sleeping bag when I approached her. \"About last night-\" \"Jake,\" she cut me off with a sigh. \"I told you it was just a nightmare. You were stressed about being out here and your brain played tricks on you. It happens.\" \"But you were outside. I had to drag you back in. Look.\" I pushed up my sleeve to show her the welts on my arm, but they had faded to faint pink lines, barely visible in the morning light. \"They were redder last night,\" I said lamely. Nancy shook her head. \"You probably scratched yourself on a branch or something when we were setting up camp.\" She went back to packing, moving with practiced efficiency. \"Can you take down the tent? I want to get going before it gets too hot.\" I stood there for a moment, wanting to argue but lacking the evidence to make my case. Eventually, I turned to the tent and began removing the stakes, feeling increasingly foolish. Had I really imagined the whole thing? The woman with her unnatural movements, Nancy's trance-like state, the struggle to get her back inside. As Nancy continued breaking camp, talking about the trail conditions and what we might have for lunch when we got back to town, I found myself wondering if maybe she was right. Maybe the stress of being in an unfamiliar environment combined with my anxiety and the strange silence had created a perfect storm for a vivid hallucination. While Nancy was busy organizing our backpacks, I walked to the edge of the clearing to the exact spot where I'd seen the woman standing. The ground there looked undisturbed. No footprints, no broken branches, no sign that anyone had been there at all. I crouched down, running my fingers through the leaves and dirt, searching for any evidence. \"What are you doing?\" Nancy called from across the clearing. I straightened up quickly. \"Nothing, just checking something.\" \"Well, hurry up. I'm almost done packing.\" I took one last look at the tree line, then rejoined Nancy by our dismantled campsite. She had already packed most of our gear, the tent being the last major item. I folded it methodically, trying to match the neat creases from when we'd first unpacked it. \"You're quiet this morning,\" Nancy observed as she handed me a granola bar. I accepted it with a nod. \"Just tired. Didn't sleep well.\" \"I slept great,\" she said, stretching her arms overhead. \"Something about the fresh air, I guess.\" As we shouldered our packs and prepared to leave, I took one final scan of our campsite, looking for anything we might've missed or any sign of what I'd experienced. The clearing looked pristine, as if we'd never been there at all. The hike back was easier than the trek in, mostly downhill and in daylight.... Nancy walked ahead of me on the narrow trail, pointing out interesting plants or bird calls. I responded with non-committal sounds. My attention divided between watching the path and constantly checking behind us. \"You keep looking over your shoulder,\" Nancy said after I'd done it for perhaps the 20th time. \"Are you worried we're being followed by a bear or something?\" \"No. Just...\" I struggled to find an explanation that wouldn't sound crazy. \"Just making sure we're not dropping anything.\" She gave me a look that said she didn't believe me, but decided not to push it. \"We're making good time. Should be back at the car in about 40 minutes.\" I nodded, adjusting my pack straps. Every time we rounded a bend in the trail or passed through a particularly dense section of forest, I felt my shoulders tense, half expecting to see that woman standing there. Her tattered clothes moving despite the still air. But there was nothing, just trees, rocks, and the occasional startled bird taking flight at our approach. The normal forest sounds continued around us, almost mockingly ordinary after the unnatural silence of yesterday. Squirrels chattered overhead, birds called back and forth, and insects buzzed among the undergrowth. Everything was as it should be in a forest, which only made my memory of the previous night seem more like a dream. \"So, I was thinking,\" Nancy said as we navigated around a fallen tree. \"Maybe next month we could try that three-day loop trail on the eastern side of the park. There's supposed to be some amazing views from the ridge.\" I nearly stumbled. \"You wanna come back here?\" \"Well, not exactly here, but yeah, same park. Why not? Apart from your nightmare, it was a pretty perfect trip, don't you think?\" I didn't answer immediately, focusing instead on a tricky section of trail where exposed roots created natural steps down a steep incline. The thought of returning to these woods, especially with the possibility of another blood moon, made my stomach tighten with dread. \"I don't know,\" I finally said. \"Maybe we could try somewhere else next time, a different park maybe.\" Nancy glanced back at me with a small frown. \"You're really shaken up by that dream, aren't you?\" \"It wasn't a dream,\" I said automatically, then regretted it when her expression shifted to concern. \"Jake, I promise you, nothing happened last night. We went to sleep, and then we woke up this morning. That's it.\" I wanted to believe her. It would be easier to accept that I'd had a vivid nightmare than to believe that some unnatural woman had been watching us from the woods, that Nancy had been in some kind of trance, drawn to this entity like a moth to flame. \"Yeah,\" I said finally. \"You're probably right.\" We continued down the trail, and I kept looking back over my shoulder, unable to shake the feeling of being watched. Each time, I saw nothing but the empty trail behind us, dappled with morning sunlight filtering through the trees. I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched as I hiked back to the trailhead with Nancy. Every few minutes, I glanced over my shoulder, scanning the trees behind us. The forest sounds had returned, birds calling, leaves rustling, but that only made me more uneasy after yesterday's unnatural silence. \"You keep looking back,\" Nancy said, pausing to wait for me on the trail. \"Did you drop something?\" \"No, just checking.\" I hurried to catch up with her, my backpack straps digging into my shoulders. The sensation of eyes on my back stayed with me for the entire hike. I kept my focus on Nancy's blue backpack ahead of me, counting steps to distract myself. Forty-five minutes later, we finally broke through the tree line into the parking lot. Our car sat where we'd left it, alongside the dusty pickup truck. I felt a wave of relief wash over me as I dropped my pack beside the trunk. Nancy unlocked the car while I loaded our gear. As I slammed the trunk closed, I took one last look at the forest edge. The trees stood motionless in the mid-morning sun, nothing moving between them, but I knew, I was certain something was still watching. \"Ready?\" Nancy asked from the driver's seat. I climbed in beside her, locked my door, and nodded. \"Let's go.\" The farther we drove from Blackwood National Forest, the more the tension in my shoulders eased. But even as the trees disappeared in the rearview mirror, I couldn't forget what I'd seen, the woman with the tattered clothes that moved without wind, Nancy's vacant stare, and the blood-red moonlight, her skin cold to the touch. Nancy drove with one hand on the wheel, the other resting on her thigh, completely at ease. She talked about work deadlines waiting for her tomorrow and asked what I wanted to do for dinner. I answered automatically, my mind still back in those woods. \"You're quiet,\" she said after a while. \"Just tired,\" I lied. \"Well, next time we'll bring better sleeping pads,\" she said with a smile. Next time, as if there would be a next time. The weeks after our camping trip passed in a blur of normalcy that felt surreal. I went to work, came home, watched TV with Nancy, all the regular patterns of our life together. Nancy never mentioned the incident again. When I tried to bring it up once, asking if she remembered anything strange about that night, she gave me a concerned look.\"You mean your nightmare? I told you, Jake, nothing happened. We slept through the night.\" I stopped bringing it up after that. What was the point? She either didn't remember or didn't want to acknowledge it. Either possibility left me feeling isolated with my memories. Two weeks after our trip, Nancy started planning our next outdoor adventure, a weekend kayaking at Lake Morrison, about three hours north of the city. \"The water will be perfect this time of year,\" she said, showing me pictures on her laptop. \"And we can camp right along the shore.\" My stomach tightened at the word 'camp', but I nodded and tried to look interested. I couldn't explain my reluctance without sounding crazy. So, I went along with her plans, helped load the kayaks onto her truck, and even managed to smile as we set up our tent by the lakeshore that Friday evening. But I didn't sleep. I lay awake both nights, listening to every sound outside our tent. The lapping of water against the shore, the distant call of a loon, the rustling of nocturnal animals in the underbrush. Each noise made me tense. When Nancy suggested a backpacking trip the following month, I agreed while silently dreading it. I went on three more trips with Nancy over the next two months. The kayaking weekend, a day hike along coastal cliffs, and an overnight backpacking trip in the mountains. Each time, I participated with growing anxiety. I checked weather forecasts obsessively, making sure we wouldn't be out during a full moon, let alone a blood moon. I packed extra flashlights and kept one within reach at all times. I volunteered for the last watch shift so I could stay awake until dawn. Nancy noticed my behavior, but misinterpreted it. \"You're really getting into this outdoor stuff,\" she said one evening as I meticulously organized my backpack for an upcoming trip. \"I'm proud of you.\" I forced a smile and kept packing, unable to tell her that I wasn't preparing, I was fortifying. The woman in tattered clothes began appearing in my dreams. Sometimes she stood at the foot of my bed, her face hidden behind that tangled curtain of hair. Other times, she circled my apartment while I watched, helpless from the window. I'd wake up gasping, drenched in sweat, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my fingertips. Nancy would stir beside me, murmur something comforting, and fall back asleep while I stared at the ceiling until morning. After one particularly vivid nightmare, I decided I needed answers. If I couldn't talk to Nancy about what happened, maybe I could find some external validation. I started researching Blackwood National Forest during my lunch breaks at work. The forest's official website offered nothing unusual, just trail maps, camping regulations and wildlife guides. I expanded my search to local news archives, scanning for any strange incidents reported in the area. Most were mundane. Hikers getting lost, minor injuries, the occasional bear sighting. Then I found an article from eight years ago about a group of college students who had gone camping in Blackwood during what the paper called \"a rare lunar eclipse.\" They had reported losing approximately six hours of time with no memory of what happened. The students were found wandering near the trailhead, disoriented, but physically unharmed. Authorities attributed the incident to carbon monoxide poisoning from an improperly ventilated camping stove. I dug deeper, joining hiking forums and local history groups online. I posted vague questions about unusual experiences in Blackwood, especially during full moons. Most responses were dismissive or joked about Bigfoot sightings, but a few people shared stories that made my skin crawl. One user claimed to have seen a woman in old-fashioned clothes walking between trees at dusk, only to disappear when approached. Another described waking up outside their tent with no memory of how they got there. A third mentioned forest silence so complete they could hear their own heartbeat. None of these accounts perfectly matched what I'd experienced, but together, they formed a pattern that was impossible to ignore. Something strange happened in those woods, especially during lunar events. The problem was none of these stories provided concrete evidence, just personal anecdotes easily dismissed as hallucinations, dreams or exaggerations. I created a document where I compiled all these accounts along with my own experience trying to find connections. The most common elements were memory loss, unusual silence, and sightings of a solitary figure, usually female, at the forest's edge. But without more substantial evidence, I couldn't prove to Nancy or anyone else that what I'd seen was real. One evening, while Nancy was at her weekly yoga class, I found myself looking at a lunar calendar online. I scrolled through the months, noting full moon dates until I froze. There was another blood moon predicted for exactly six months after our camping trip. I stared at the screen, my mouth dry. Part of me wanted to plan another trip to Blackwood for that night, to see if the woman would appear again. Maybe with preparation and forewarning, I could document what happened, gather evidence. But a stronger, more rational part of me recoiled at the thought of deliberately putting Nancy or myself in that situation again. I closed the laptop and walked to the window of our apartment, looking out at the city lights that kept the natural darkness at bay.Out there, beyond those lights, beyond the noise and concrete and human activity, something waited in the wilderness. Something that had watched us through the trees, that had somehow called to Nancy while she slept. I remained convinced that we had encountered something beyond human understanding that night, something that had been waiting for an opportunity that thankfully never came. What would have happened if I hadn't managed to drag Nancy back to the tent? What would have happened if the woman had approached us? These questions haunted me, but I had no answers, just scattered stories and my own unreliable memories. When Nancy returned from yoga, she found me still standing at the window. \"Everything okay?\" she asked, setting down her mat. \"Yeah,\" I said, turning away from the darkness outside. \"Everything's fine.\" But I knew I would never again feel safe sleeping in the wilderness, not with the memory of that woman's presence still vivid in my mind. Whatever watched us that night was still out there, waiting in the spaces between trees, in the silence between heartbeats, for someone else to wander into its domain during a blood moon. I noticed the changes in Nancy gradually. At first, they were subtle shifts I could almost convince myself weren't happening. A lingering glance toward the night sky, a moment of stillness by the window when the moon was visible, nothing that couldn't be explained away, until I couldn't explain it anymore. About a month after our camping trip to Blackwood, I came home from work to find Nancy standing at our apartment window, completely motionless. She'd been like this more and more lately, her body rigid, her attention fixed upward at the waxing moon hanging in the early evening sky. \"Nancy,\" I called, setting my keys on the counter. \"I picked up that Thai food you wanted.\" She didn't respond. I walked over and touched her shoulder gently. She blinked several times as if waking from a daydream. \"Jake, when did you get home?\" She turned to me, her eyes refocusing. \"Just now. You were staring at the moon again.\" \"Was I?\" She glanced back at the window, then shook her head. \"I was just thinking about work stuff, lost track of time.\" I nodded, not pushing it, though I'd caught her like this three times this week alone. Sometimes she'd stand there for hours if I didn't interrupt her. I unpacked the food while she set the table, our routine feeling normal for a few precious minutes. It wasn't until I was reaching for plates in the cabinet that I noticed the windowsill. \"What's all this?\" I asked, pointing to a careful arrangement of objects lined up in a semi-circular pattern. Nancy looked over, her brow furrowing. \"What's all what?\" I moved closer to examine the collection. Three smooth stones with unusual red veining, a twisted branch that curved back on itself like a hook, what appeared to be the dried remains of a cicada, its wings spread wide, two acorns positioned precisely at equal distances from a small pile of what looked like dried moss. \"This,\" I said, gesturing to the arrangement, \"did you collect these on our hike last weekend?\" Nancy walked over and stared at the objects. Her face showed genuine confusion. \"I didn't put those there,\" she said, her voice small. \"They just appeared on our windowsill.\" I tried to keep my tone light, but my stomach tightened. \"I don't remember gathering any of this stuff.\" She picked up one of the stones, turning it over in her hand. \"Maybe I did it without thinking. I've been so tired lately.\" I wanted to believe her, wanted to think she'd collected these items on a whim and forgotten about it. But the precision of their arrangement, the careful spacing, the deliberate pattern, felt intentional, methodical. \"Let's eat before the food gets cold,\" I said, taking the stone from her hand and placing it back exactly where she'd had it. Something told me not to disturb the arrangement. Over the next two weeks, the collection grew. New stones appeared, along with feathers, more twisted sticks, and once a perfectly preserved butterfly with blue wings. Nancy never remembered collecting them. I started taking photos of the arrangement each morning before leaving for work, confirming my suspicion that she was rearranging them throughout the day, the pattern gradually becoming more complex. I researched the patterns online when Nancy wasn't around. Nothing concrete came up, but some of the arrangements reminded me of old protection symbols or pagan offerings. The thought did nothing to ease my growing anxiety. One night, I woke suddenly from a dreamless sleep. The digital clock on my nightstand read 3:17 in the morning. Nancy's side of the bed was empty, the sheets cold. I sat up, rubbing my eyes. \"Nancy?\" I called softly. No answer. I climbed out of bed, the hardwood floor cold against my bare feet. Our apartment was small, a bedroom, bathroom, living room with an attached kitchen, and a narrow balcony. There weren't many places she could be. The bathroom was dark and empty, same for the living room. A quick glance toward our kitchen showed no sign of her. That left only one place. The curtains covering our balcony door billowed slightly, indicating it was open. I moved toward it, my heart beating faster with each step.When I pushed the curtain aside, I saw her. Nancy stood in the center of our small balcony, wearing only her thin, white nightgown. Her back was to me, her face tilted upward toward the three-quarter moon hanging in the clear night sky. Her arms hung at her sides, palms facing forward. \"Nancy?\" I whispered, stepping onto the balcony. She gave no indication that she'd heard me. As I moved closer, I realized her lips were moving, forming words I couldn't hear. I took another step forward, and that's when I caught it, a whispered stream of sounds that resembled no language I recognized. The syllables had a rhythm to them, rising and falling in a pattern that made my skin crawl. It wasn't Spanish or French or any language I'd heard Nancy speak or study. The sounds seemed to catch in her throat, guttural and ancient. \"Nancy,\" I said more firmly, touching her shoulder. She turned toward me with a fluid, unnatural motion. Her eyes were wide open but vacant, the same empty stare I'd seen that night in the forest. Moonlight reflected in her pupils, creating an eerie glow that didn't look human. Her head tilted slightly, regarding me with detached curiosity. \"Hey,\" I said softly, trying to keep the fear from my voice. \"Let's go back inside. It's the middle of the night.\" Nancy continued staring at me, her lips still forming those strange words. I gently took her hand, intending to guide her back through the door. The moment our skin touched, a jolt ran through me like static electricity. For a split second, so brief I almost doubted it happened, Nancy's face seemed to flicker. In that instant, I saw another face superimposed over hers, the gaunt, ancient face of the woman from the forest. Her tangled hair framing hollow eyes and a mouth stretched too wide. I jerked back, nearly letting go of Nancy's hand. The vision vanished as quickly as it had appeared, leaving only Nancy standing before me, still in her trance-like state. Fighting my instinct to run, I took a deep breath and gently tugged her hand again. \"Come on, let's get you back to bed.\" This time, she followed without resistance, her movements mechanical and stiff. I led her through the apartment to our bedroom, where she lay down without a word. Within moments, her breathing deepened, and she appeared to be asleep. I sat on the edge of the bed, my hands shaking. What I'd just seen was impossible. People's faces don't flicker and change. Yet I couldn't deny what had happened. For that fraction of a second, I'd seen the forest woman looking out through Nancy's eyes. I spent the rest of the night sitting up in bed beside Nancy, too afraid to sleep. My mind raced through everything that had happened since our camping trip. Nancy's growing obsession with the moon, the strange collections, her missing time and memory gaps, and now this nocturnal ritual. The woman from the forest, whatever she was, hadn't stayed behind when we left Blackwood. Something had followed us home. Something had attached itself to Nancy. As the first light of dawn filtered through our curtains, I made my decision. We needed to go back to Blackwood Forest. Whatever had connected with Nancy that night under the blood moon wasn't going to let go on its own. If I wanted to free her from this influence, we needed to return to where it started. I looked down at Nancy, now sleeping peacefully beside me, looking completely normal and undisturbed. I would take her back during the next full moon. I would find a way to confront this entity and break its hold on her. I had no idea how I'd do it, but I knew I couldn't live like this anymore, watching the woman I loved slowly disappear into someone or something else. I loaded the last of my gear into the trunk of my car, making sure the backpack with my special supplies was buried underneath our regular camping equipment. Nancy stood by the passenger door, smiling as she scrolled through her phone. \"The weather's perfect for the whole weekend,\" she said. \"Your photography project should have great lighting.\" I nodded, trying to look enthusiastic about the fake reason I'd given for returning to Blackwood Forest. The photography project was a lie I'd come up with after watching Nancy stand at our apartment window for the third time that week, staring at the moon with that vacant expression that wasn't hers. \"Yeah. Golden hour should be amazing in that clearing.\" My voice sounded steadier than I felt. \"You ready?\" Nancy climbed into the passenger seat with an eagerness that surprised me. For weeks, she'd been distant, collecting strange objects, speaking in languages I'd never heard her use. But today, she seemed almost like her old self, laughing at my jokes on the drive, pointing out interesting landmarks, suggesting stops for snacks. If I hadn't seen her standing on our balcony at 3:00 in the morning, whispering to the moon with someone else's face flickering over hers, I might've believed everything was normal. The three-hour drive to Blackwood passed too quickly. With each mile marker, my grip on the steering wheel tightened. The backpack hidden in the trunk contained salt, iron nails, and bundles of sage I'd bought from three different new age shops across the city. I'd spent nights researching protection rituals while Nancy slept beside me, reading folklore websites and obscure forums where people shared encounters with things that shouldn't exist.\"Remember how quiet it was last time?\" Nancy asked as we turned onto the forest access road. \"Like the whole forest was holding its breath.\" I glanced at her, searching for any sign that she remembered what really happened that night. The woman with tattered clothes, Nancy's cold skin, the way she'd fought me when I dragged her back to the tent, but her expression was open, excited. Whatever had attached itself to her had buried those memories deep. The parking lot held only two other vehicles, a green Subaru and a park ranger's truck. I parked in the same spot as before, took a deep breath, and stepped out into the cool afternoon air. Nancy was already grabbing her pack from the trunk. \"Let's take the same trail as last time,\" she suggested. \"I liked that clearing.\" Of course she would. Something was pulling her back there, and it wasn't her. I shouldered my pack, feeling the weight of the iron nails shifting against my back. \"Sounds good.\" We hiked in companionable silence for the first 30 minutes. The forest around us buzzed with normal sounds, birds calling, insects humming, leaves rustling. Nothing like the unnatural silence from our previous visit. Not yet, anyway. \"You've been quiet lately,\" Nancy said as we navigated around a fallen tree. \"Everything okay with us?\" I forced a smile. \"Yeah, of course. Just been busy with work and thinking about this trip.\" \"You seem different, more serious.\" She reached for my hand and squeezed it. The gesture felt so normal, so Nancy, that for a moment, I questioned everything. Maybe I had imagined it all, the woman, the trance, the collection of objects, Nancy's face changing, but I knew what I'd seen. We reached the clearing around 4:00 in the afternoon. The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the open space. The same fallen log sat where we'd left it, moss-covered and weathered. The trees surrounding the clearing seemed to lean inward, watching. \"Perfect timing,\" I said, setting down my pack. \"We'll have about two hours of good light before sunset.\" Nancy dropped her pack next to mine and stretched her arms overhead. \"Want me to set up the tent while you get your camera gear ready?\" \"Sure.\" I unzipped my pack and pulled out my camera, making a show of checking lenses and settings while keeping an eye on Nancy. She moved with her usual efficiency, laying out the tent components and securing the corners with stakes. As the sun dipped lower, I wandered the clearing, pretending to take photos while actually searching for the best spot to create my protective circle later. The center of the clearing seemed ideal, open space, flat ground, clear sight lines to the forest edge where we'd seen the woman before. Nancy finished with the tent and joined me, wrapping her arms around my waist from behind. \"Getting any good shots?\" \"Some.\" I lowered the camera. \"The light's not quite right yet.\" We ate a simple dinner of trail mix and energy bars as sunset painted the sky in oranges and pinks. Nancy chatted about work projects and plans for her upcoming birthday, all perfectly normal conversation. But as darkness crept in from the edges of the clearing, I noticed her sentences growing shorter, her responses delayed. The moon rose, nearly full, but not quite. A calculated risk on my part. I needed moonlight for what was coming, but not the power of a complete blood moon. Nancy's gaze drifted more and more toward the tree line. Her eyes tracking something I couldn't see. \"Nancy.\" I touched her shoulder. \"You cold? We could get the sleeping bags out.\" She didn't respond immediately. When she finally turned to me, her smile seemed forced. \"No, I'm fine. Just enjoying the night air.\" Darkness enveloped us completely by 8 o'clock. I set up my small camp lantern, casting just enough light to see by. Nancy sat on the fallen log, her back unnaturally straight, head turning slowly to track the moon's progress across the sky. \"I'm going to get some night shots,\" I announced, reaching into my pack. My fingers closed around the bag of iron nails. Not yet. I grabbed my tripod instead. \"Hmm? Oh, okay.\" Nancy's voice sounded distant. I set up the tripod near our tent, positioning myself to keep Nancy in my peripheral vision. The forest had grown quieter with each passing minute. Bird calls ceased, insect sounds faded, the rustling of leaves stilled. The same unnatural silence from our last visit settled over the clearing like a heavy blanket. When the moon reached its highest point, Nancy stood up. The movement was fluid, too graceful to be natural. Without a word, she began walking toward the forest edge. \"Nancy,\" I called after her. \"Where are you going?\" She didn't turn or acknowledge me. Her steps were measured, deliberate, carrying her directly toward the spot where we'd seen the woman before. \"Nancy,\" I called louder, abandoning the tripod and hurrying after her. \"Nancy, stop.\" She halted at the exact edge of the clearing where forest's shadow met moonlight. Her back was to me, head tilted upward toward the moon. When I reached her side, I saw her lips moving, forming words in that same strange language I'd heard on our balcony.... the forest around us went completely silent. Not a branch creaked, not a leaf stirred. The air felt heavy, charged with something ancient and patient. \"Nancy, we need to go back to the tent.\" I tugged at her arm, but she might as well have been carved from stone. That's when I saw it. Movement in the darkness between the trees. At first, just a shadow, darker than the surrounding night. Then it took shape. A woman in tattered clothes that billowed around her as if under water despite the still air. She materialized from the darkness like she was part of it, stepping forward until moonlight caught the tangled mass of her hair. My heart hammered against my ribs. This was what I'd come for, what I'd prepared for. But seeing her again sent ice through my veins. Nancy's whispers grew louder, more urgent. Her body leaning forward as if being pulled by an invisible thread. I had seconds to act. Yanking the bag of iron nails from my pocket, I moved between Nancy and the entity, backing us up several steps. The woman's form flickered like a television with poor reception. Solid one moment and transparent the next. \"Stay back,\" I shouted, though I knew whatever this thing was, it wouldn't respond to human commands. With shaking hands, I scattered iron nails in a wide circle around Nancy and myself, closing the loop completely. From my backpack, I pulled out the sage bundle and lighter I'd prepared. The entity drifted closer. Its movements jerky and wrong. Nancy's whispers turned to moans. Her body straining toward the woman as if magnetized. I struck the lighter, hands trembling so badly I needed three attempts before the flame caught. The sage bundle ignited, sending thick white smoke curling into the night air. I waved it in wide arcs, creating a barrier of smoke between us and the entity. The effect was immediate. The woman recoiled. Her form flickering more violently. A sound came from her. Not from a mouth, but from everywhere at once. A high, thin screech that pierced my eardrums like needles. Pain exploded in my ears. I felt warmth running down the sides of my neck, and realized with horror that my ears were bleeding. The sound continued, rising in pitch until it seemed to vibrate through my bones. Nancy collapsed against me, her body convulsing. I caught her with one arm, holding her upright while maintaining my grip on the burning sage with my other hand. \"Leave her alone,\" I shouted over the terrible noise. \"She's not yours to take.\" The entity circled our protective barrier, testing it, looking for weakness. I could feel its hunger, its ancient patience turning to frustration as it encountered the iron nails it couldn't cross. I held Nancy tighter as her body shook. Blood trickled from my ears down my neck, soaking into my collar. The protective phrases I'd memorized tumbled from my lips. Words collected from a dozen different traditions, prayers and commands and pleas strung together in desperate hope. \"By iron and salt, by sage and light, you have no power here,\" I recited, my voice growing stronger with each word. \"What walks between worlds must return to its own. What hunts in darkness must flee from light.\" The woman's form became more frantic, circling faster. Her tattered clothes whipping around her as if caught in a storm. The face I'd never fully seen before began to take shape. Ancient and wrong, with features that shifted and changed as I watched. \"Nancy is protected. Nancy is claimed. Nancy is not yours to take.\" I shouted the words directly at the entity, holding Nancy's convulsing form against my chest. The woman released another shriek. This one so powerful it knocked the breath from my lungs. But I kept reciting the protective phrases, waving the burning sage in wide arcs. Maintaining our position inside the circle of iron nails. \"Release her,\" I commanded. \"By all that stands between worlds. By the barriers that separate what should not meet. Release her now.\" Nancy's convulsions grew more violent. I struggled to hold her upright while maintaining the sage barrier. Blood from my ears dripped onto her hair, but I couldn't spare a hand to wipe it away. The entity made one final circuit around our protective circle, its movements becoming more erratic, more desperate. The face that had been hidden behind tangled hair became fully visible for one terrible moment. Too many eyes arranged in patterns that hurt to look at, and a mouth that opened impossibly wide, revealing darkness deeper than the night around us. I stared directly at that face, refusing to look away despite the wrongness of it, and finished the last of my protective phrases. \"What has been taken must be returned. What has been bound must be released. Nancy returns to herself whole and free.\" The entity lunged toward us, hitting the invisible barrier created by the iron nails. Its form shattered like glass, dissolving into mist that writhed and twisted before dispersing into the night air. A final scream echoed through the forest, fading slowly until only the ringing in my damaged ears remained. Nancy went limp in my arms. I lowered her gently to the ground, keeping us both within the protective circle.... her eyes remained closed, her breathing shallow but steady. \"Nancy,\" I whispered, touching her face. \"Nancy, can you hear me?\" Her eyelids fluttered then opened. For the first time in weeks, her gaze was clear, focused, truly seeing me. \"Jake.\" Her voice was weak, confused. \"What happened? Where are we?\" I pulled her closer, relief flooding through me. \"We're in Blackwood Forest. You're going to be okay now.\" \"I don't understand.\" Nancy tried to sit up, wincing. \"Why are we here? And...\" Her eyes widened as she noticed the blood on my neck. \"You're bleeding.\" \"It's nothing,\" I lied, still holding the smoking sage bundle. \"Just a small cut. Everything's fine now.\" Nancy looked around, taking in the circle of iron nails, the burning sage, the dark forest beyond our small protected space. \"Jake, what's going on? What happened to me?\" I hesitated, unsure how much to tell her. \"Something followed us home from our last trip here. It was affecting you. I brought you back to fix it.\" Understanding dawned in her eyes, mixed with fear. \"The dreams I've been having, standing at windows without remembering how I got there. The collection of things I didn't remember gathering.\" She clutched my arm. \"It was real? All of it was real?\" I nodded, keeping my eyes on the tree line. The entity was gone, but I wasn't taking any chances. \"We need to stay in this circle until morning. It's safer that way.\" Nancy huddled against me, trembling. \"I remember bits and pieces. A woman watching me. A voice in my head that wasn't mine.\" She looked up at me. \"You saved me.\" I tightened my arm around her shoulders. \"I couldn't lose you.\" We sat in silence for several minutes, both watching the darkness beyond our protective circle. The forest remained unnaturally quiet, but the oppressive feeling had lifted. \"The woman in the woods,\" Nancy said softly. \"She was real too, wasn't she? That night with the blood moon.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Everything I told you was real. She was real.\" Nancy pressed closer to me. \"What was she?\" I shook my head. \"I don't know. Something old. Something that doesn't belong in our world, at least not completely. Something that hunts during blood moons and can attach itself to people.\" \"Will she come back?\" I looked at the dissipating smoke from the sage bundle, at the circle of iron nails surrounding us, at the ordinary moon overhead. \"Not tonight, and hopefully never for us. But she's still out there, somewhere between worlds.\" Nancy shuddered. \"I feel like parts of me are missing, like there are holes in my memory.\" \"They might come back or they might not,\" I said honestly. \"But you're you again. That's what matters.\" We fell silent again, watching the forest, listening to the unnatural quiet. I maintained my vigil, sage bundle in hand, while Nancy drifted in and out of sleep against my shoulder. Blood had dried on my neck, my ears still rang painfully, but Nancy was herself again. Whatever had attached to her was gone, at least for now. The entity had been banished, but as I stared into the darkness beyond our protective circle, I knew we weren't truly safe. Not here. Not in Blackwood Forest. Perhaps not anywhere when the moon was full and red and ancient things stirred in the spaces between worlds. But for tonight, within our circle of iron and salt, with sage smoke still lingering in the air, we had won a temporary reprieve. I shouted at the empty forest where the entity had been, my voice hoarse but determined. \"She's not yours. You can't have her.\" The words echoed through the silent trees unanswered. Nancy stirred against me, murmuring in her sleep, but didn't wake. I tightened my hold on her and continued my watch, determined to protect her until dawn broke over the eastern horizon. I watched the entity recoil from the burning sage, its form rippling like disturbed water. The smoke curled upward in gray tendrils, creating a barrier that seemed to physically pain the creature. Its body flickered between solid and see-through, like bad reception on an old TV. One second, I could see the trees behind it. The next, it was there, a dark mass of tattered cloth and tangled hair. \"Nancy, stay with me,\" I said, pulling her inside the iron nail circle I'd scattered earlier. Her body moved mechanically, following my guidance, but not truly present. Her eyes remained fixed on the creature, reflecting moonlight in an unnatural way. The entity prowled the perimeter of our makeshift protection, testing for weaknesses. It moved in ways that hurt my eyes to follow, jerky one moment, fluid the next. The nails seemed to create an invisible wall it couldn't cross, though it stretched what passed for hands toward us, fingers too long and jointed in places fingers shouldn't bend. \"You don't belong here,\" I said, my voice stronger than I felt. \"You don't own her.\" I continued reciting the protective phrases I'd memorized, a patchwork of different traditions and beliefs I'd found in my research. I didn't know which might work, so I used them all,\"By salt and iron, by sage and smoke, I command you to release her,\" I chanted, holding the smoking bundle higher. \"What walks between worlds must return to its own. What hunts in darkness must retreat from light.\" The entity's movements grew more frantic, circling faster, its tattered clothes billowing despite the still air. It made a sound like radio static mixed with the distant cry of some animal I couldn't identify. The noise scraped against my eardrums, making me wince, but I kept going. \"Nancy belongs to herself. Her mind is her own. Her soul is her own.\" Suddenly, Nancy's body went rigid in my arms. Her back arched at an angle that looked painful, her muscles tightening under my grip. Then she began to convulse, her limbs jerking violently against me. \"Nancy,\" I cried out, trying to hold her steady without restricting her too much. I'd read somewhere you shouldn't restrain someone having a seizure, but I couldn't let her thrash out of the circle either. I lowered us both to the ground, keeping one arm around her while my other hand maintained the burning sage. \"Let her go!\" I shouted at the entity, fear and rage making my voice crack. \"Whatever hold you have on her, break it now.\" The convulsions grew worse. Nancy's eyes rolled back, showing only whites. Her breathing came in short, sharp gasps. I felt utterly helpless watching her suffer, knowing I had caused this by bringing her back here. But there had been no other choice. The thing had followed us home, had been slowly taking her over for weeks. The entity stopped its circling and drew itself up to its full height. The darkness within its tattered form seemed to deepen, pulling in the surrounding night. For the first time, I could see its face as it pushed forward toward our barrier. What I saw wasn't a face at all, not really. It was ancient, beyond comprehension, a thing that existed before humans had words to describe nightmares. Too many eyes blinked across its surface in wrong patterns, some lidded sideways, others pulsing with their own light. Its mouth opened wider than any mouth should, revealing not teeth, but a deeper darkness within, a void that seemed to pull at something inside me. I couldn't look away. Those eyes fixed on mine, and I felt a pressure building in my head, a silent demand to step outside the circle, to bring Nancy with me. \"No,\" I said, the word barely audible even to myself. The entity lunged forward with impossible speed, a final desperate attempt to reach us. It slammed against our invisible barrier, and it shattered. Like glass breaking into a thousand pieces, its form fragmented and dissolved into mist. A scream tore through the forest, high-pitched and inhuman, making my ears ring painfully. The sound faded slowly, echoing between the trees until silence returned. Nancy's body went limp in my arms. The convulsions stopped as suddenly as they had begun. I dropped the sage, now burned down to almost nothing, and cradled her face in my hands. \"Nancy? Nancy, can you hear me?\" Her eyelids fluttered, then opened. Her eyes were clear, truly clear for the first time in weeks. The vacant stare was gone, replaced by confusion and recognition. \"Jake?\" she whispered, her voice hoarse. \"What... Where are we?\" She looked around, taking in the dark forest and the circle of iron nails surrounding us. \"Why are we back here?\" Relief flooded through me so intensely I almost cried. \"You're back,\" I said, pulling her against my chest. \"You're really back.\" \"I don't understand,\" she said, pushing away slightly to look at my face. \"Did something happen? Your ears, they're bleeding.\" I touched my ear, and my fingers came away red. The entity's final scream must've done physical damage. \"It's okay,\" I assured her. \"Everything's okay now.\" \"The last thing I remember clearly is...\" She frowned, concentrating. \"We were at home. I was standing at the window y- looking at the moon. And there was something else there, watching me. Watching through me.\" She shuddered. \"After that, everything's in pieces. Fragments of dreams, or not dreams.\" \"Something followed us home from our last trip here,\" I explained, keeping my arms around her. \"It was affecting you, changing you. I had to bring us back to fix it.\" \"The woman,\" Nancy whispered, her eyes widening. \"The woman in the woods. She was in my head, Jake, talking to me. Using my hands to collect things, arrange them. Using my mouth to say words I didn't understand.\" Her hands clutched at my jacket. \"Parts of me feel missing, like there are holes where memories should be.\" \"That's still you,\" I said firmly. \"All you. The holes will fill in with time.\" We stayed inside the protective circle for the rest of the night. Neither of us suggested leaving until daylight came. Nancy drifted in and out of sleep against my shoulder while I kept watch, my ears still ringing, dried blood crusted on my neck. The iron nails remained undisturbed around us, and I didn't dare move them until morning. Nancy told me about fragments she remembered, standing at our apartment window for hours without knowing why,... collecting strange objects from parks and roadsides without remembering doing it, dreams of a woman watching her from the corner of every room. She remembered voices in her head that weren't hers, urging her to do things, say things. \"Am I myself again?\" she asked at one point, her voice small in the darkness. \"Yes,\" I told her, though I couldn't be completely sure. \"You're you.\" When the first light of dawn filtered through the trees, we finally felt safe enough to stand. My legs were stiff and numb from sitting on the hard ground all night. Nancy was unsteady on her feet, leaning against me for support. We packed our few belongings quickly, neither of us wanting to spend another minute in that clearing. The hike out was silent. Birds had returned to the forest, their calls a welcome reminder of normal life. The trail seemed shorter in daylight, less threatening. By the time we reached the parking lot, the sun was fully up, turning the morning mist golden. As we loaded our gear into the car, I looked back at the forest one last time. It looked ordinary now, just trees and underbrush, but I knew better. I knew what waited in there, or things like it, ancient and patient and hungry. Maybe we had banished this particular entity, but others existed. They waited in the spaces between worlds, in forgotten places, in the silence that falls when all natural sounds cease. \"I'm never coming back here,\" I said quietly, more to myself than to Nancy. \"Not to Blackwood, not to any wilderness during a blood moon.\" Nancy nodded, her face pale but determined. \"We'll stay in the city when the moon turns red,\" she agreed, \"where there's light and noise and people.\" As we drove away, I couldn't shake the memory of that face. Too many eyes, that impossible mouth. I knew it would visit my nightmares for years to come. Some knowledge can't be unlearned. Some sights can't be unseen. We would carry this with us forever, the understanding that the world is stranger and more dangerous than most people ever realize, and that ancient things still hunt in forgotten places."
