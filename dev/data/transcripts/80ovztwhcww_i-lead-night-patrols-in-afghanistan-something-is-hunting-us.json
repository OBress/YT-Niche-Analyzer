  "full_text": "I checked my equipment one last time before gathering the squad. Five rookies, all fresh faces with barely any field experience. Kyle kept fidgeting with his night vision goggles while Raiden methodically counted his ammunition for what had to be the third time. Marvin and Randy stood at attention, trying to look seasoned despite the nervousness in their eyes. Jorge was the only one who seemed truly calm, but even he kept checking his radio more than necessary. \"Listen up,\" I said, keeping my voice low as we huddled in the makeshift briefing area. \"Tonight's patrol is straightforward. We're moving through the eastern sector of Kalar Village, standard sweep pattern. Our intel suggests minimal activity, but stay alert.\" I'd led dozens of night patrols just like this one through similar villages. The routine was practically muscle memory at this point. Sweep the area, maintain visibility on your squad mates, report anything suspicious. But something felt off tonight, a heaviness in my gut that I couldn't shake. I unfolded the map on the crate between us, tracing our route with my finger. \"We'll enter here, move through the market district, circle around the mosque, and exit through the northern pathway. Four hours total. Questions?\" Kyle raised his hand slightly. \"Sir, what about the reported movement from yesterday's patrol?\" \"Likely nothing,\" I said, though I didn't entirely believe it. \"But that's why we're checking. Remember your training. Watch for trip wires, especially near doorways and alleyway entrances. Maintain radio silence unless absolutely necessary. If you see something, signal first. Don't just start shooting.\" I looked at each of them in turn, making sure my words sank in. \"This isn't a combat mission. We observe, we report, we return. No heroes tonight.\" The rookies nodded. Their faces serious in the dim light of our outpost. \"Gear up. We move out at 21:00 hours.\" As they dispersed to make final preparations, I checked my own weapon again, an unconscious habit borne from years in the field. The weight of the rifle was reassuring, but it didn't dispel the unease crawling up my spine. At exactly nine o'clock, we slipped out of the compound and into the darkness. The night air felt cool against my face, carrying the familiar sense of dust and distant cooking fires, except there weren't any cooking fires tonight. That was the first thing I noticed. Kalar Village was usually active well into the evening, with families gathering for late meals, voices carrying through the narrow streets. Tonight, there was nothing. \"Stay tight,\" I whispered as we moved in formation. The green glow of our night vision equipment gave the landscape an otherworldly appearance, transforming the mud-brick buildings into ghostly structures. We passed the first cluster of homes, moving like shadows along the walls. Kyle was on point, his movements jerky but disciplined. Raiden covered our rear, his head constantly swiveling as he scanned for threats. The training was there, even if the experience wasn't. Twenty minutes into the patrol, the silence became impossible to ignore. No dogs barking, no children being hushed to bed, no radios playing music from inside homes. Just the soft crunch of our boots on the dusty ground and the occasional click of equipment. \"Sergeant,\" Marvin whispered, his voice barely audible. \"Where is everyone?\" I shook my head slightly, signaling him to maintain silence, but the question echoed my own thoughts. Villages like this never emptied completely, not even when trouble was expected. There were always the elderly who refused to leave, the stubborn farmers who stayed with their livestock. But every doorway we passed was dark, every window shuttered. We reached the market district, moving between abandoned stalls and empty carts. Our night vision revealed goods still laid out on some tables. Fruits, fabrics, household items, as if the vendors had simply walked away in the middle of business. It wasn't right. Nothing about this felt right. I signaled for the squad to tighten formation as we approached the central square. The mosque stood silent against the night sky, its minaret reaching upward like an accusing finger. According to the mission brief, this was where we might encounter activity, but the square was as lifeless as the rest of the village. Jorge caught my eye and tapped his ear, then gestured to the surrounding buildings. He was right. The silence was more than just an absence of people. There were no insects buzzing, no night birds calling, no wind rustling through the few trees. It was as if the village itself was holding its breath. We continued our patrol, each empty doorway and abandoned market stall only amplifying my discomfort. The rookies were feeling it too. Randy's grip on his rifle had tightened, his knuckles white. Marvin kept glancing over his shoulder. Even Raiden, the steadiest of the group, was blinking more than usual as if trying to clear his vision of something that wasn't there. I'd been in ambushes before. I'd walked into traps. This didn't feel like either of those. This felt like walking into a place where humans simply weren't meant to be, not anymore. But orders were orders, and our route was clear. We pressed forward, our footsteps eerily loud in the unnatural quiet. The green glow of our equipment casting shadows that seemed to move on their own.As we approached the northern section of our patrol route, I found myself counting the minutes until we could turn back. The village layout was familiar from the briefings, but in the night, with every building empty and silent, it felt like navigating through a ghost town. The narrow alleys between homes seemed darker than they should be, swallowing our night vision's reach. Kyle signaled from the front, pointing to a door left ajar. Standard procedure was to check and clear, but something made me hesitate. The door swayed slightly, though there was no breeze. I motioned for Kyle to continue past it. We weren't here to clear buildings tonight, just to patrol and observe. That's what I told myself anyway. The truth was, I didn't wanna know what might be waiting inside. We continued through the village according to plan, professional and methodical despite the growing sense of wrongness that seemed to press against us from all sides. The rookies were handling it better than I expected, maintaining formation and staying vigilant. Their training was holding, even as the atmosphere of the place tried to unravel it. I checked my watch. We were halfway through our patrol route, moving at a good pace despite the tension. Everything was going according to plan, except for the complete absence of any sign of life in a village that should've held hundreds of people. I told myself there was a logical explanation. Perhaps a wedding or celebration in a neighboring village had drawn everyone away, or news of our patrol had spread and the locals had chosen to stay indoors. But deep down, I knew better. In all my deployments, I'd never seen anything like this. And as we pressed forward through the silent streets of Kalar, the green glow of our night vision equipment turning the familiar into something alien, I couldn't shake the feeling that we weren't alone after all. That something was watching us, waiting, as we moved deeper into the empty village. I watched Kyle getting more jumpy with every passing minute. 30 minutes into our patrol through the deserted village, his head kept snapping left and right. The barrel of his M4 following his gaze. The green glow of night vision made everything look alien, but the kid was acting like he'd been dropped on another planet entirely. \"Steady, Dennis,\" I whispered, keeping my voice low. \"Maintain your sector.\" Kyle nodded quickly, but didn't stop scanning. His breathing had picked up, short, shallow pulls of air that would mess with his aim if he needed to fire. I'd seen this before with rookies on their first real patrol. The emptiness of the village was getting to all of them, but Kyle was taking it worst. I checked our formation. Marvin and Randy maintained their positions, moving with a careful precision we'd drilled into them. Jorge kept his eyes forward, radio at the ready. Only Raiden at the rear seemed distracted, but at least he wasn't pointing his weapon at shadows. Kyle suddenly froze, his rifle snapping up toward an alley between two mud brick buildings about 20 yards ahead. \"Contact,\" he hissed, his voice cracking. \"Right there. Tall guy, long coat.\" I followed his aim, but saw nothing, just an empty alleyway cutting between buildings. \"I don't see anything,\" I said, moving closer to him. \"Lower your weapon.\" But Kyle's eyes had gone wide behind his night vision goggles. His finger moved to the trigger. \"He's right there, Sarge.\" \"Dennis, stand down.\" Three shots cracked through the silence before I could grab his weapon. The muzzle flash exploded in my night vision, turning everything into blinding white light. I tore off my goggles, blinking against sudden blindness. Around me, the rest of the squad did the same, cursing under their breath. \"What the hell, Dennis?\" I grabbed him by his tactical vest, pulling him back. \"I gave you a direct order.\" \"I saw someone,\" Kyle insisted, his voice pitched high with fear. \"Standing right there, watching us.\" I pushed him back toward the others. \"Contraris, Pearson, security. Warren, Garcia, keep your sectors.\" I moved toward the alley, rifle up, night vision useless until my eyes readjusted. I switched on my weapon light instead, sweeping the narrow passage between buildings. Nothing, no blood spatter on the walls, no body. No signs anyone had been there at all. Just empty space and undisturbed dust on the ground. I moved deeper into the alley, checking every corner and recess. The beam of my light revealed only crumbling mud brick and abandoned trash, not even footprints besides my own. When I returned to the squad, I didn't bother hiding my anger. \"There's nothing there,\" I said, getting right in Kyle's face. \"No target, no evidence anyone was ever there.\" \"But I saw...\" \"You fired without confirmation or authorization.\" I cut him off. \"You just announced our position to every hostile in a five-mile radius. If there are any fighters in this village, they know exactly where we are now.\" Kyle's face fell, the reality of what he'd done sinking in. The rest of the squad looked tense, eyes darting between shadows now that their night vision was compromised. \"Check your sectors,\" I ordered. \"We're moving out. Standard formation, stay tight.\" I turned back to Kyle. \"You're in the middle now. Contraris takes point.\" We reorganized quickly, Marvin moving to the front position while Kyle shuffled to the center of our formation, head down.I could practically feel the tension radiating from the squad, not just the normal alertness of a patrol, but something deeper, more primal. Kyle's shots had shattered whatever composure they'd been maintaining. We continued through the village, moving more cautiously now. Every doorway seemed to hold potential threats. Every window looked like it might frame a sniper. I kept expecting contact, real contact after Kyle's shots, but the village remained as eerily silent as when we'd entered. 10 minutes later, I noticed Raiden falling behind. He'd been solid all night, watching our six with the steadiness I expected from him. Now, he kept pausing, turning his head to look at something, then shaking it off and continuing. His lips were moving. I dropped back, signaling for Jorge to maintain pace with the others. \"Warren,\" I said quietly when I reached him. \"What's going on?\" Raiden startled like I'd shocked him. \"Nothing, Sarge.\" \"You're talking to yourself and lagging behind. That's not nothing.\" He hesitated, then admitted, \"I keep seeing something move just at the edge of my vision.\" He gestured vaguely to his right. \"Like someone walking alongside us, but when I turn to look, there's nothing there.\" I studied his face. Raiden wasn't the jumpy type. Farm kid from Nebraska, steady as they come. If he was seeing things... \"When did this start?\" \"After Dennis fired,\" he said. \"At first, I thought it was just my eyes readjusting, but it keeps happening.\" Before I could question him further, Marvin's voice crackled through my radio. \"Sarge, we've got movement ahead, multiple contacts approaching our position from the north.\" I moved forward quickly, rejoining the main group. \"How many? What are they doing?\" \"Can't tell,\" Marvin replied, voice tight. \"They're moving between buildings fast.\" I scanned ahead, seeing nothing but empty streets. The squad had taken cover behind a low wall, weapons trained northward. \"Spread out,\" I ordered. \"Garcia, get on the radio. Call in our...\" Something moved in my peripheral vision. I turned sharply, raising my rifle. A tall figure slipped between two buildings about 40 yards to our right. My first thought was that Kyle hadn't been wrong after all. The silhouette matched what he'd described. Tall, wearing what looked like a long coat or robe that flowed behind it as it moved, but the way it moved, it crossed the 20-foot gap between buildings in what seemed like a single step, the coat billowing out behind it as if caught in a strong wind, except there was no wind. The air around us was completely still, had been all night. I blinked, wondering if my eyes were playing tricks on me after the night vision disruption. When I looked again, the figure was gone. \"Did you see that?\" I asked, not addressing anyone specifically. \"See what, Sarge?\" Jorge asked, radio handset pressed to his ear. I kept my eyes fixed on the spot where the figure had disappeared. \"Movement, right side between those buildings.\" Marvin swung his rifle in that direction. \"I don't see anything.\" I wasn't sure what I'd seen either, but something had moved through that space, something that didn't move like a person, and its coat had rippled in a breeze that didn't exist. The tall figure moved with unnatural speed. One moment it stood at the edge of the alley, and the next, it was behind Randy. I opened my mouth to shout a warning, but it was already too late. The creature struck Randy from behind with terrible force. His body flew forward like a ragdoll, slamming into the mud-brick wall with a sickening thud. His weapon clattered to the ground as he crumpled, lying motionless in the dirt. \"Fall back. Everyone fall back now,\" I shouted, my training kicking in even as my mind struggled to process what I was seeing. Randy didn't move. He lay face down, one arm twisted at an unnatural angle beneath him. The night vision gave his still form an eerie green glow against the wall. Marvin was the first to react. He stepped forward from our position behind the low wall, raised his M4, and opened fire. The muzzle flashes lit up the narrow street in strobing bursts as he emptied his entire magazine at the figure. I watched in disbelief as the bullets passed through the tall form without effect. The rounds kicked up dust from the wall behind it, but the figure itself remained unmoved as if Marvin was shooting at empty air. It stood there, coat rippling without wind, watching us with what seemed like curiosity. \"It's not working,\" Marvin shouted, his voice cracking with panic as he fumbled to reload. \"The bullets are going right through it.\" The figure moved again, but not like any human I'd ever seen. Its form seemed to dissolve at the edges, becoming smoke-like before reappearing several yards away. One second it stood near Randy's body, the next it was at the corner of a building, then vanishing completely, only to materialize closer to our position. My radio crackled. Jorge's voice came through, high and terrified. \"It's here. It's right behind me. I don't know how...\" His words dissolved into a scream that made my blood run cold. Then silence. \"Garcia, report,\" I shouted into my radio. Nothing but static answered me. I grabbed Raiden by his tactical vest and yanked him toward a narrow alley to our right. \"Move!\"\"We need cover,\" Marvin's voice burst through the radio, words tumbling over each other in desperation. \"I can't see it anymore. Where did it... Oh God, it's right here. It's touching me. Please.\" His transmission cut off mid-sentence. I pulled Raiden deeper into the alley, both of us breathing hard. Half my squad had vanished in moments. Randy down, Jorge and Marvin gone silent. I tried to think, to fall back on my years of training, but nothing had prepared me for this. \"Sergeant, what the hell is happening?\" Raiden whispered, his normally steady voice trembling. I keyed my radio again. \"Kyle, report position. Kyle, do you copy?\" After a moment of static, Kyle's voice came through so quiet I could barely make out the words. \"I'm in a drainage ditch east of the mosque. It... It took them, didn't it? I heard the screams.\" I could hear the raw panic in his voice, the shallow breathing of someone barely holding it together. \"Stay put. I'm coming to you. Keep your head down and stay quiet.\" I tried to sound calm and in control, but the truth was hammering through my mind with each heartbeat. Nothing in my military training had prepared me for this. Whatever was hunting us moved like smoke, appeared and disappeared at will, and ignored bullets completely. It struck with lethal precision, taking out three of my men in minutes. This wasn't an insurgent attack or any conventional threat. This was something else entirely. \"We need to get to Kyle,\" I told Raiden, checking my weapon even though I'd just seen how useless it was. \"Stay close to the buildings and move fast.\" As we prepared to leave our temporary shelter, I realized with growing dread that I had no idea how to fight something that bullets couldn't touch. For the first time in my military career, I was completely out of my depth. I crawled through the final stretch of alley, keeping close to the mud-brick wall, my rifle held ready despite knowing it would do nothing against whatever hunted us. Raiden followed behind me, his breathing quick and shallow. We'd been moving through the village in short bursts, stopping to listen between each advance. The eastern sector of Kalar lay ahead, where Kyle had said he was hiding. The drainage ditch came into view, a shallow concrete channel that ran alongside the eastern wall of the mosque. I signaled Raiden to cover me, then moved forward in a crouch, scanning for movement. \"Kyle,\" I whispered, approaching the edge of the ditch. \"Kyle, it's Sergeant Bowen.\" A small sound came from deeper in the shadow of the concrete channel, something between a whimper and a hushed breath. I peered over the edge and found Kyle curled up at the bottom, his back pressed against the wall, knees drawn to his chest. His hands clutched his rifle with white knuckles, and his eyes... God! His eyes were wide open, unblinking, staring at nothing. \"Kyle,\" I said, keeping my voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through me. \"We need to move now.\" He didn't respond, just kept staring ahead. His pupils dilated to black pools in the darkness. I slid down into the ditch beside him, careful to keep my movements slow and deliberate. Up close, I could see he was trembling. \"Dennis,\" I said, using his last name to snap him back to training. \"Report.\" Kyle blinked once, his gaze finally focusing on my face. \"Sarge,\" his voice cracked. \"It took them. It took all of them.\" \"I know.\" I gripped his shoulder firmly. \"But we're still here, and we need to get to the extraction point. Can you stand?\" He nodded mechanically but made no move to get up. Raiden appeared at the edge of the ditch above us, his silhouette tense as he kept watch. \"Warren,\" I called up softly. \"See anything?\" \"Nothing, Sarge,\" Raiden whispered back. But the tremor in his voice told me he was expecting that to change any second. I turned back to Kyle and grasped his tactical vest, helping him to his feet. His legs seemed barely able to support him, but he stood, still clutching his rifle like it was the only solid thing left in his world. \"Listen to me,\" I said, holding his gaze. \"We're moving to the extraction point. Stay close, stay quiet, and do exactly as I say. Understand?\" Kyle nodded again, some small measure of military discipline returning to his posture. I pulled myself out of the ditch first, then reached down to help Kyle up. With Raiden covering our rear, we began moving through the eastern edge of the village, keeping to shadows and walls whenever possible. The extraction point was at the northern perimeter, maybe half a mile away. Under normal circumstances, we could make it in 20 minutes. These were not normal circumstances. The village remained eerily silent as we moved. No wind, no animals, no distant voices. Just the sound of our boots on dirt and our controlled breathing. Kyle stayed close behind me while Raiden brought up the rear, both of them following my hand signals as we navigated between buildings. We'd made it about 200 yards when I felt it, that crawling sensation on the back of my neck that told me we were being watched. I raised my fist, bringing our small group to an immediate halt. Kyle nearly bumped into me, his coordination still off from shock. I scanned the area ahead, seeing nothing but empty doorways and abandoned market stalls.... then movement. A shadow shifted in a doorway 30 yards ahead, tall coat-like shape that seemed to ripple despite the still air. I blinked, and it was gone. \"Did you see that?\" Kyle whispered, his voice barely audible. I nodded once, signaling for us to change direction. We turned down a narrow side street, moving faster now. The feeling of being hunted grew stronger with each step. As we passed another abandoned home, I caught it again, the tall figure standing motionless in the darkened doorway. This time, I was certain it was watching us. Before I could raise my weapon, it simply wasn't there anymore. \"It's toying with us,\" Raiden murmured from behind. He was right. Whatever this thing was, it could have taken us already if it wanted to. It was playing with us like a cat with mice. We pushed on, changing direction twice more when we spotted the figure. It appeared in windows, doorways, alleyways, never in the same place twice, never close enough to engage, but always watching, always aware of our movements before we made them. My radio crackled suddenly, the sound shockingly loud in the silence. Static burst through the speaker, making Kyle jump and Raiden swear under his breath. I reached to turn it off when a voice came through, Marvin's voice. \"Sergeant, help me. It's here.\" My blood ran cold. Marvin was gone. I'd heard his transmission cut off. This wasn't possible. The static returned, then cleared to reveal Jorge's voice. \"Behind me. I can't. No. Please.\" Then Randy's voice joined in, overlapping with the others, all of them calling for help, begging, screaming. The sounds of my men dying played through my radio, their voices distorted and echoing. \"Turn it off,\" Kyle whispered, his face pale in the darkness. \"Turn it off.\" I switched the radio off, but the voices continued for several seconds before fading. The realization hit me like a physical blow. The creature was using our own equipment against us, our own men's final moments as a weapon. \"It's not real,\" I told Kyle and Raiden, trying to keep my voice steady. \"It's using psychological warfare. Stay focused.\" We continued moving, faster now, no longer trying to be stealthy. Speed had become more important than stealth. The thing knew exactly where we were anyway. The extraction point was maybe 300 yards ahead. The radio crackled to life again, despite being switched off. This time, it was my own voice that came through. \"Kyle, Raiden, I'm hit. Need assistance.\" Kyle's head snapped toward me, confusion crossing his face as he looked from me to the radio on my vest. \"It's not me,\" I said firmly. \"It's mimicking. Keep moving.\" But the damage was done. The fake transmission continued, my voice becoming more desperate, calling for help, describing injuries in vivid detail. Kyle's breathing accelerated, his eyes darting between me and the darkness around us. \"Dennis, look at me,\" I ordered. \"It's not real. We stay together.\" Kyle nodded, but I could see the terror building in him, pushing him toward the edge of control. The radio continued its psychological assault, now cycling through all our voices, living and dead, creating a cacophony of pleas and screams. We reached an intersection between two narrow streets. I paused, checking both directions before signaling to move right. That's when Kyle broke. \"I can't,\" he cried out, suddenly backing away from me. \"It's everywhere. We can't get out.\" \"Dennis,\" I hissed. \"Stay in formation.\" But Kyle was beyond orders now. His eyes were wild, seeing things I couldn't see. Before I could grab him, he turned and sprinted down the left passage, disappearing into the darkness. \"Kyle,\" I shouted, abandoning stealth completely. \"Stop. That's an order.\" Raiden looked at me, panic clear on his face. \"Sarge?\" \"Stay close,\" I commanded, then took off after Kyle. I ran down the narrow street, my boots pounding on the packed earth. Ahead, I could just make out Kyle's form as he darted between buildings, running blindly away from our position. The radio at my chest continued its horrific broadcast, the voices of my men following me through the darkness. I pushed harder, trying to close the distance. Kyle was younger, faster, but terror made his movements erratic. He stumbled once, regained his footing, and veered down another alley. I followed, aware that Raiden was falling behind, but unable to slow down. I couldn't lose another man, not like this. The village seemed to shift around us as we ran, alleys appearing where I didn't remember them, buildings looming larger than they should, or maybe it was just the adrenaline and fear distorting my perception. Either way, I was losing track of our position relative to the extraction point. Kyle disappeared around another corner. I followed, lungs burning, and nearly collided with him when I found him standing frozen in the middle of a small courtyard, staring ahead at nothing I could see. \"Kyle,\" I gasped, reaching for him. \"We need to stay together.\" He didn't respond, didn't even seem to hear me. I grabbed his shoulder and tried to turn him around, but he remained rigid, his eyes fixed on some point in the darkness beyond. That's when I felt it, a presence behind me, watching,I turned slowly, rifle raised, despite knowing its uselessness, and saw nothing. But the feeling remained, growing stronger. The creature was close, closer than it had been all night. \"Dennis, we need to move,\" I said, my voice low and urgent. \"Now.\" Kyle finally turned to look at me, his face slack with terror. \"It's right there,\" he whispered. \"Can't you see it?\" I looked again and saw only shadows, but Kyle saw something, something that had him paralyzed with fear. \"Raiden?\" I called out, suddenly aware that our third man hadn't caught up. No answer came. The village swallowed my voice like it had swallowed my men. The radio crackled once more, and this time, it was Kyle's voice that came through, not pleading or screaming, but laughing, a high, broken sound that bore no resemblance to the young soldier standing before me. Kyle's eyes widened as he heard his own voice emanating from my radio. The laughter cut off abruptly, replaced by a single word in Kyle's voice, \"Run.\" And then he did exactly that, tearing away from me with sudden desperate energy, sprinting down another dark alley before I could stop him. \"Kyle,\" I shouted, taking off after him again. \"Dennis, stop.\" I chased him through the darkened streets, the village becoming a maze around us. Each time I thought I was gaining on him, he would turn another corner or duck through another passage. The creature's presence followed us, sometimes ahead, sometimes behind, always just out of sight, but never out of mind. As I rounded another corner, I caught a glimpse of Kyle standing frozen in the middle of the street about 30 yards ahead. Relief surged through me. I could catch him now, get us back on track to the extraction point. I ran toward him, calling his name, but as I drew closer, I saw what had stopped him. A tall figure loomed behind Kyle, its long coat rippling without wind. Even from this distance, I could tell Kyle was terrified beyond movement, beyond thought. I raised my rifle instinctively, knowing it would do nothing, but unable to stop myself. My finger tensed on the trigger as I continued forward, desperate to reach Kyle before the creature could take him too. I ran after Kyle, my boots pounding against the dirt as I tried to close the gap between us. The village streets twisted into a maze around me, each turn leading deeper into darkness. Every few seconds, I caught glimpses of Kyle's back as he darted between buildings, his movements frantic and desperate. \"Kyle, stop. That's an order,\" I shouted, my voice bouncing off the mud brick walls. My radio continued its twisted broadcast, cycling through the voices of my men. Jorge's pleas cut through the static, followed by Marvin's screams, then Randy's final gasps. The sounds chased me through the night like invisible predators. I pushed harder, lungs burning as I sprinted around another corner. The village seemed to shift around me, alleys appearing where none should be, buildings looming larger than I remembered from the patrol maps. I'd lost all sense of our position relative to the extraction point, all tactical awareness gone in the chaos of pursuit. \"Dennis, we need to stay together,\" I called out, but my words fell into empty air. I rounded another corner and skidded to a stop. There, 30 yards ahead, Kyle stood frozen in the middle of the street. His back was to me, rifle hanging limply from one hand, his entire body rigid with terror. Relief flooded through me. I'd caught up to him. We still had a chance. \"Kyle,\" I called, moving forward at a run. \"Don't move. I'm coming.\" As I closed the distance, something shifted in the shadows behind Kyle. The air seemed to thicken, darkness pooling and stretching upward until it took shape, the tall figure with its long coat materializing as if from the night itself. It loomed directly behind Kyle, at least seven feet tall, the edges of its coat rippling without wind. My training kicked in automatically. I raised my rifle, centering the sights on the mass where a chest should be, knowing bullets had passed through it before, but having no other option, my finger tensed on the trigger. Before I could fire, Kyle crumpled. There was no sound, no visible strike. He simply collapsed to the ground like his strings had been cut, falling face first into the dirt. His rifle clattered beside him, the sound unnaturally loud in the quiet street. The figure turned toward me, the movement fluid, yet wrong, like watching water flow uphill. The hood shifted, and for the first time, I could see what lay beneath. Nothing, absolutely nothing. Where a face should've been was only emptiness, a void darker than the night around us, a shadow so deep it seemed to pull at my vision. No eyes, no mouth, no features of any kind, just absence. Something primitive broke inside me. Every bit of training, every procedure, every tactical response I'd ever learned shattered in that moment. The rifle suddenly felt useless in my hands, my body foreign and clumsy. I ran. I didn't make a conscious decision. My body simply turned and fled, boots scrambling for purchase on the dusty ground. The radio at my hip erupted with new sounds, Kyle's voice now, his final moments joining the chorus of my dead squad. \"It's inside. It's inside.\" Kyle's voice crackled through the static, breaking into a sound that wasn't quite human.I tore the radio from my vest and threw it away without stopping, but the voices continued, somehow following me through the air itself. My men dying over and over, their final moments played on repeat like some sick recording. I sprinted through the village streets, all thoughts of tactical movement abandoned. No more hugging walls or checking corners, just raw animal flight. My breath came in ragged gasps, sweat pouring down my face despite the night chill. Left turn, right turn, straight ahead. I moved without plan or purpose, focused only on putting distance between myself and that faceless thing. My training screamed at me to stop, to think, to form a strategy. But those rational thoughts couldn't penetrate the primal fear driving me forward. The village seemed to stretch endlessly around me, streets I'd never seen on any map appearing before me. Buildings I passed looked wrong, too tall, too crooked, windows like watching eyes. I had no idea where I was anymore, no sense of direction or position. The extraction point could've been anywhere. I just ran, letting instinct guide my feet through the darkness, the sounds of my dying men echoing in my ears even without the radio. Behind me, always behind me, I felt the presence moving unhurried but relentless, a predator that knew its prey had nowhere to go. I reached the outskirts of Kalar Village as the first gray light of dawn crept over the jagged mountain peaks. My lungs burned with each ragged breath, legs trembling from hours of running. I stumbled to a stop, bracing my hands on my knees and waited for the creature to catch me. Nothing happened. I turned, scanning the empty streets behind me. The tall figure that had pursued me relentlessly through the night was gone. I blinked hard, trying to clear my vision. The narrow path leading back into the village remained empty, silent in the pale morning light. The thing had stopped, just stopped, as if the growing daylight had somehow driven it away. I took a few unsteady steps backward, keeping my eyes fixed on the village entrance. Part of me expected the creature to materialize from the shadows, that empty void where a face should be turning toward me. But the streets remained still. No movement, no rippling coat, no squad voices carrying through the air. My squad, Kyle collapsing face first into the dirt, Jorge's screams cutting off mid-transmission, Randy's body thrown against the wall like a rag doll, Marvin firing uselessly at something bullets couldn't touch. Raiden, where had Raiden gone? I opened my mouth to call out, but my voice emerged as little more than a hoarse whisper. \"Warren. Raiden.\" No answer came, just the growing light and the distant call of a bird somewhere in the mountains. The adrenaline that had kept me moving through the night suddenly drained from my body. My rifle slipped from numb fingers and clattered to the ground. I tried to bend and retrieve it, muscle memory from years of training, but my legs buckled beneath me. I hit the ground hard, my knees and palms scraping against the rocky soil. The pain felt distant, unimportant. I rolled onto my back, staring up at the lightening sky as black spots danced across my vision. My men were gone, all of them, taken by something I couldn't fight or understand, something that moved like smoke and walked through bullets, something with no face. The last thing I saw before consciousness slipped away was the sun cresting the eastern mountains, painting the sky in shades of red that reminded me of blood. \"Got a pulse. He's alive.\" Unfamiliar hands touched my neck, my wrist, lifted my eyelids. I tried to speak but couldn't form words. \"Staff Sergeant Bowen, can you hear me?\" I managed to open my eyes. A medic in full gear leaned over me, his face partially obscured by his helmet. Behind him, the rhythmic thump of helicopter rotors filled the air. \"We've got you, Sergeant. You're safe now.\" Safe. The word seemed meaningless after what I'd seen. \"My squad,\" I croaked, my throat raw from screaming. \"Did you find them?\" The medic glanced at someone I couldn't see, then back to me. \"Let's focus on you right now. Can you tell me if you're injured?\" I tried to sit up, but firm hands pressed me back down. \"My squad,\" I repeated, \"Five men, Dennis, Warren, Contreras, Pearson, Garcia. Did you find them?\" \"We haven't found anyone else yet, Sergeant. You were alone when we spotted you.\" Alone. The word echoed in my head as they lifted me onto a stretcher. The sky tilted and swayed above me as they carried me toward the waiting helicopter. I caught glimpses of other soldiers moving in formation, sweeping the village perimeter with weapons ready. They wouldn't find anything, not in the daylight. Someone secured the stretcher inside the helicopter. The noise was deafening, but somehow I could still hear the voices of my men crying out for help. I pressed my hands against my ears, but it didn't stop. \"Sergeant Bowen,\" a different voice said close to my ear. \"I'm Captain Reeves. Can you tell me what happened to your patrol?\"I lowered my hands and found myself looking up at an officer I recognized from base operations. His face was tense, concerned. \"It took them,\" I said. \"Who took them? Insurgents?\" I shook my head weakly. \"Not who, what. It wasn't human.\" Captain Reeves frowned, exchanging a look with the medic. \"Sergeant, were you attacked? Did you see who ambushed your squad?\" \"Not an ambush.\" My words slurred together as exhaustion pulled at me. \"Something in the village. Tall, moved like smoke. Bullets went right through it.\" The helicopter lifted off, the sudden motion sending a wave of nausea through me. I closed my eyes, fighting the urge to vomit. \"He's in shock,\" I heard the medic say. \"Possible concussion, severe dehydration.\" \"Five men don't just disappear,\" Reeves replied. \"And look at his boots. He's been running for hours.\" I forced my eyes open again. \"It took them one by one. Started with Pearson, then Garcia, Contreras. It was hunting us.\" \"Hunting you?\" Reeves leaned closer. \"Who, Sergeant? Taliban? Local militia?\" \"Not who,\" I repeated, frustration building. Why wouldn't they listen? \"It wasn't human. It had no face, just emptiness, darkness.\" The medic and Reeves exchanged another look. I recognized that look, the silent communication that said I wasn't making sense. \"We'll find your men, Sergeant,\" Reeves said, his tone gentler now. \"You just focus on getting treatment.\" I wanted to grab him, to make him understand, but my arms felt weighted down. The helicopter continued its journey back to base as I drifted in and out of consciousness. The medical examination room was too bright, too sterile after the darkness of Kalar Village. I sat on the edge of an examination table, a blanket wrapped around my shoulders. A doctor, Simmons according to his nameplate, checked my pupils with a penlight while a nurse recorded my vitals. \"Pupils equal and reactive,\" Simmons noted. \"No signs of head trauma. Blood pressure still elevated.\" I hadn't spoken since they'd brought me in. What was the point? They wouldn't believe me. The door opened and two officers entered, Captain Reeves from the helicopter and Major Kelly, the battalion XO. They nodded to the doctor, who stepped back. \"How is he?\" Major Kelly asked. \"Physically, he's suffering from extreme exhaustion and dehydration,\" Simmons replied. \"Some minor lacerations and contusions consistent with running through rough terrain. No serious injuries.\" \"And mentally?\" The doctor hesitated. \"He's responsive but withdrawn. Given the circumstances, that's not unexpected.\" Major Kelly approached me, his face set in professional concern. \"Staff Sergeant Bowen, I understand you've been through an ordeal. But we need to know what happened to your patrol.\" I looked up at him, seeing the same skepticism I'd seen in Reeves' eyes, but I had to try again. \"We were conducting a standard sweep through Kalar,\" I began, my voice rough. \"Village was empty, completely deserted. Then we started seeing something moving between buildings.\" \"Insurgents?\" Kelly prompted. I shook my head. \"Not human. Tall, seven feet at least. Long coat that moved without wind. It took Pearson first. Threw him against a wall like he weighed nothing.\" I described everything, how Marvin's bullets passed through the creature without effect. How it appeared and disappeared at will. How it hunted us through the village. How Kyle collapsed without being touched. \"It was playing with us,\" I said. \"Using our radio to broadcast their voices even after I threw the radio away. Making the village shift around us so we couldn't find our way out.\" The room fell silent when I finished. Major Kelly's expression had hardened into something unreadable. \"Doctor,\" he said without looking away from me, \"would you give us the room, please?\" Simmons nodded and left with the nurse, closing the door behind them. \"Eddie,\" Major Kelly said, using my first name for the first time. \"I want to be clear. You're saying some kind of supernatural entity attacked your squad?\" \"I know how it sounds, sir.\" \"Do you?\" Kelly's voice sharpened. \"Because what you're describing isn't possible. People don't move like smoke. Bullets don't pass through solid objects.\" \"I saw it, sir. We all saw it.\" \"And yet you're the only one here to report it.\" Kelly paced the small room. \"We have a situation, Sergeant. Five soldiers are missing. Their families will want answers. Command will want answers. And your explanation is that a ghost took them?\" \"Not a ghost,\" I insisted, feeling a surge of anger. \"I don't know what it was, but it was real. It was hunting us.\" \"The Taliban has been active in that region,\" Captain Reeves said. \"Intelligence suggests they've been moving through Kalar at night.\" I stared at him in disbelief. \"This wasn't the Taliban.\" \"You were exhausted,\" Kelly continued as if I hadn't spoken. \"Night vision can play tricks. Stress affects perception. After the first man went down, panic set in.\" \"I didn't panic,\" I said through clenched teeth. \"I've been in combat before. I know what I saw.\"\"What you think you saw,\" Kelly corrected. \"The mind fills in gaps under stress, creates narratives to make sense of chaos.\" I stood up, letting the blanket fall from my shoulders. \"Sir, with respect, you weren't there. This thing took my men, one by one, and it let me live. It chased me all night, and then just stopped at dawn.\" Kelly and Reeves exchanged that look again, the one that said I'd lost touch with reality. \"We'll find your men, Sergeant,\" Kelly said, his tone making it clear he didn't believe a word I'd said. \"A rescue team is conducting a thorough sweep of the village and surrounding area.\" \"You won't find them,\" I said, my voice rising. \"Not with daylight searches, not with standard tactics. This thing doesn't follow rules. It's still there, waiting for dark.\" \"Sergeant Bowen,\" Kelly's voice hardened, \"I understand you've been through a traumatic experience.\" \"You don't understand anything,\" the words burst out of me. \"My entire squad is gone, taken by something bullets can't hurt, and you're standing there talking about the Taliban?\" Kelly stepped back, his hand moving subtly toward his sidearm. Reeves moved to the door, opening it slightly. \"I need to go back,\" I said, taking a step forward. \"I need to find them before night falls again.\" \"That's not happening, Sergeant.\" Kelly's voice was firm. \"You need rest and medical observation.\" A medical officer appeared in the doorway, syringe in hand. I recognized the standard sedative they used for soldiers experiencing combat stress. \"No,\" I said, backing away. \"You need to listen to me. It's still there, in the village, waiting. And if you send men in after dark-\" \"This is for your own good, Eddie,\" Kelly said as the medical officer approached. \"You need to calm down.\" \"I am calm,\" I shouted, knowing as the words left my mouth that they undermined my claim. \"You have to believe me. It wasn't human. It had no face. Just darkness where a face should be. It moved like...\" The needle slid into my arm before I could finish. I tried to pull away, but Reeves and another soldier I hadn't noticed entering held me still. \"My men,\" I said, my voice already beginning to slur as the sedative took effect. \"You have to understand. Not Taliban. Something else. No face. Just empty.\" My legs gave out and they lowered me onto the examination table. The ceiling tiles blurred above me as the medication pulled me down into darkness. \"It's waiting,\" I managed to whisper as consciousness slipped away. \"It's still there, waiting for night.\" But they weren't listening anymore. The truth about what happened in Kalar Village faded with my voice, lost in the haze of medication and disbelief. I sat across from Major Kelly in a windowless conference room, my hands resting on the metal table between us. The overhead lights buzzed faintly, casting harsh shadows across his face as he flipped through a folder of papers. Captain Reeves stood in the corner, arms crossed, watching me with that same look of skepticism he'd warned since they'd found me outside Kalar. Three days had passed since I'd been sedated in the medical facility. Three days of tests, questions, and growing isolation, as the story of what happened to my squad took shape without my input. \"Staff Sergeant Bowen,\" Major Kelly began, his voice flat and official. \"We've completed our preliminary investigation into the incident at Kalar Village.\" I straightened in my chair. \"And my men? Any sign of them?\" \"We've conducted extensive sweeps of the area. Based on shell casings, blood evidence, and signs of struggle, we've determined your squad encountered a coordinated Taliban ambush.\" My mouth went dry. \"That's not what happened, sir.\" Kelly continued as if I hadn't spoken. \"Intelligence indicates a Taliban cell has been operating in that region. They likely observed your patrol and set up the ambush. We believe they removed the bodies to prevent identification and potential recovery.\" \"With all due respect, sir, that's not possible. I told you what I saw. What took my men wasn't human.\" Reeves shifted his weight, exchanging a look with Kelly that made my stomach turn. \"Sergeant Bowen,\" Kelly said, his tone softening in a way that felt rehearsed. \"You were the sole survivor of a traumatic combat situation. You ran through rough terrain for hours in the dark. Your perceptions were compromised.\" I leaned forward. \"My perceptions were fine. I know what I saw. The thing moved like smoke. Bullets passed right through it. It hunted us one by one.\" Kelly closed the folder. \"Eddie, there are no supernatural predators in Afghanistan. There are, however, Taliban fighters who know the terrain and can move effectively at night.\" \"Then explain how Marvin emptied an entire magazine into it without effect.\" \"In high-stress situations, even trained soldiers miss targets. The human mind fills gaps with explanations it can process.\" I slammed my palm on the table. \"This wasn't stress-induced hallucination. My entire squad saw it too before they were taken.\" A new voice entered the conversation. \"Staff Sergeant Bowen, I'm Dr. Winters.\" I turned to see a woman in civilian clothes standing in the doorway. She wore glasses and carried a leather-bound notebook. \"Dr. Winters is a military psychologist,\" Kelly explained.\"She's here to help us understand what you experienced.\" She took a seat beside Kelly, opening her notebook. \"Eddie? May I call you Eddie?\" I didn't respond. \"The symptoms you're describing are consistent with acute stress reaction and survivor's guilt. These can manifest as shared hallucinations, especially in combat situations.\" \"It wasn't a hallucination,\" I said through clenched teeth. She made a note. \"You mentioned this entity took your men. Could you explain what you mean by that?\" I described it again, the tall figure with the coat that moved without wind. How it appeared behind Randy and threw him against the wall. How Marvin's bullets passed through it. How it used our radio to broadcast the voices of my men even after I threw the radio away. Dr. Winters nodded sympathetically while writing. \"And you believe you were the only one who escaped?\" \"It let me go. When the sun came up, it stopped chasing me.\" \"Why do you think that is?\" She asked. The question caught me off guard. \"I don't know.\" \"Have you considered that your mind might be creating this narrative to explain why you survived when your men didn't?\" I stared at her. \"You think I made this up because I feel guilty about surviving?\" \"Survivor's guilt is a powerful psychological force. It can create elaborate explanations to justify why someone lived when others died.\" \"This isn't about guilt,\" I insisted. \"I'm telling you what happened.\" Dr. Winters exchanged glances with Kelly before continuing. \"Eddie, I'm diagnosing you with post-traumatic stress disorder with features of survivor's guilt. These conditions can create vivid, convincing alternate realities that feel as real as actual memories.\" I looked from face to face around the table, seeing nothing but disbelief. \"You've already decided I'm crazy.\" \"Not crazy,\" Dr. Winters corrected. \"Traumatized. There's a significant difference.\" Major Kelly cleared his throat. \"The official report will state that your squad was ambushed by Taliban insurgents. The bodies were removed from the scene, which is consistent with known enemy tactics in the region.\" \"So, you're just going to lie?\" I asked. \"We're documenting the most plausible explanation based on evidence and known threats in the area,\" Reeves interjected. I turned to him. \"And what about the evidence I've given you? My testimony...\" \"Your testimony has been noted,\" Kelly said. \"But given your psychological state at the time of the incident, it cannot be considered reliable for official purposes.\" \"This is bullshit,\" I said, standing up. \"My men weren't killed by Taliban. They were taken by something else. Something that hunts at night.\" Dr. Winters made, Dr. Winters made another note in her book. \"Eddie, please sit down. Your agitation only reinforces our concerns about your mental state.\" I remained standing, looking between the three of them. \"You need to listen to me. If you send more men into Kalar after dark, they'll disappear too.\" \"Sergeant Bowen,\" Major Kelly's voice hardened. \"You will sit down now.\" I slowly lowered myself back into the chair, my hands shaking with frustration. \"We've already conducted night operations in the area,\" Reeves said. \"Two full squads swept the village last night. They found nothing unusual.\" My blood ran cold. \"They went in at night? And they all came back?\" \"Every single man,\" Kelly confirmed. \"No supernatural entities. No Taliban either for that matter.\" That didn't make sense. The thing had been there, hunting us systematically through the darkness. Why would it vanish completely? \"Maybe it left,\" I said, thinking aloud. \"Or maybe it's waiting for something specific.\" Dr. Winters wrote something else down. \"Eddie, do you hear how this sounds? You're creating an unfalsifiable theory. If evidence contradicts your belief, you simply adapt the belief rather than reconsider it.\" \"I know what I saw,\" I repeated, but my voice lacked its earlier conviction. \"What you believe you saw,\" she corrected gently. The debriefing continued for another hour. They asked the same questions in different ways, trying to get me to admit I might have been confused or mistaken. I stuck to my story, but with each retelling, I could see them growing more convinced of my delusion. Finally, Major Kelly closed his folder with a sense of finality. \"Staff Sergeant Bowen, here's what's going to happen. You're being placed on medical leave effective immediately. Dr. Winters will oversee your treatment, and once cleared, you'll receive orders for reassignment.\" \"You're removing me from combat duty,\" I said flatly. \"Temporarily,\" Dr. Winters assured me, though her tone suggested otherwise. I leaned forward. \"What about my men? Their families deserve to know what really happened.\" \"The families will be informed that their sons died heroically in service to their country,\" Kelly said. \"They'll be told that enemy action prevented recovery of the bodies.\" \"So, more lies.\" Kelly's expression hardened. \"Sergeant Bowen, I understand you're processing a traumatic event, but I need to be clear. If you continue to insist on this supernatural explanation or attempt to contact the families with these stories, you will face psychiatric detention. Do you understand?\" The threat hung in the air between us.Psychiatric detention meant being locked away, medicated into compliance, my credibility permanently destroyed. \"Do you understand, Sergeant?\" he repeated. I met his gaze. \"Yes, sir. I understand.\" \"Good,\" he nodded. \"You're dismissed. Report to medical for your new prescription and processing.\" I stood up, saluted mechanically, and left the room. As I walked down the hallway, the reality of my situation sank in. They'd created their narrative. The official story was written, filed, and closed. My men would be remembered as victims of a Taliban ambush, their bodies lost to the mountains of Afghanistan, and I would be the broken survivor, the man who cracked under pressure and invented ghost stories to cope with his guilt. Back in my quarters that evening, I sat on the edge of my bed staring at the bottle of pills they'd given me. The label read, \"For anxiety and sleep disturbance. Take one tablet before bedtime.\" I set them aside without opening the cap. My gaze fell on my radio sitting on the desk across the room, standard issue, same as the one I'd thrown away in Cholar. The power light was off. A faint sound came from the speaker. I froze, listening intently. \"Help us.\" The voice was barely audible, like a whisper carried on static. I approached slowly, my heart pounding. The radio remained off, the power indicator dark. \"Sergeant?\" It was Kyle's voice, thin and distant. I grabbed the radio, checking the power switch, definitely off. I unplugged it from the wall for good measure. \"It's still here.\" Marvin's voice now replaced by Jorge's, then Randy's, cycling through my squad, their whispers overlapping into a course of please. I dropped the radio, backing away until I hit the wall. The voices continued, growing slightly louder, then fading back to whispers. \"This isn't real,\" I said aloud. \"This is what Winters warned about, auditory hallucinations.\" But the voices continued, sometimes clear enough to make out words, sometimes just desperate sounds. I covered my ears, but it made no difference. I grabbed the bottle of pills, twisted off the cap, and swallowed one dry. Then I lay down on my bed staring at the ceiling, waiting for the medication to take effect. The voices from the radio persisted, whispering my name now, asking why I left them, why I ran, why I lived when they died. Was this guilt manifesting as hallucination just as Dr. Winters suggested? Or was the thing from Kalar reaching across distance, tormenting me with the voices of my men? I couldn't tell anymore. The line between what I knew happened and what they told me happened was blurring. The official report would say Taliban. The families would be told their sons died in combat. The military bureaucracy had systematically erased the truth, replacing it with something explainable, something that fit their understanding of the world. And here I lay, listening to impossible voices from a powered down radio, questioning my own sanity. The medication began to take effect, making my thoughts fuzzy and distant. But even as consciousness slipped away, I heard Kyle's voice one last time, clear and distinct. \"It's waiting for you to come back.\" I closed my eyes, no longer certain of anything except that the men I led into Cholar Village were gone, and no one would ever know the truth of what took them. I sat at my kitchen table surrounded by a half dozen empty coffee cups and scattered papers. The clock on the microwave showed 3:27 in the morning, but I'd stopped noticing the time days ago. The discharge papers lay in the corner of the table. Honorable discharge, medical reasons, PTSD diagnosis in clinical language that made what happened sound so ordinary, so explainable. Four months since Cholar, four months since I'd watched my entire squad vanish into the darkness. Four months of pills that didn't work, therapists who didn't believe me, and nights where I couldn't close my eyes without hearing their voices. I picked up the orange prescription bottle and rattled it. Still half full. I was supposed to take them twice daily, but most days I skipped the morning dose. The fog they put me in was worse than the memories, almost worse. My apartment was small but functional, standard veteran transition housing with bare white walls I hadn't bothered to decorate. The neighbors probably hated me by now. Hard not to when the guy next door wakes up screaming three or four nights a week. Last night it had been Kyle's voice. Not the Kyle who joked around at base, or the one who'd been so nervous checking his night vision goggles before we left. The Kyle from my last glimpse of him, frozen in terror in that empty street, then collapsing face first into the dirt without a sound when that thing touched him. I rubbed my eyes and looked back at the papers spread across the table. Military incident reports from five different combat zones, newspaper clippings, forum posts from family members, all of them with the same pattern. Patrols gone missing, lone survivors reporting impossible things, official reports citing enemy action despite lack of evidence.The thing that took my men had been busy long before we walked into Kalar. My phone buzzed, and I jumped. Text message from Dr. Winters, the military psychologist they'd assigned to my case. \"Eddie, confirm you're still coming to your 10:00 AM appointment. We need to discuss medication compliance.\" I didn't respond. I'd go, but I wasn't in the mood for another lecture about how I needed to fully commit to treatment if I wanted to process the trauma properly, as if the pills could make me forget what I saw. The truth had been haunting me for months now. That thing could've taken me too. It had every chance. It chased me through those twisted streets all night, always right behind me, never quite catching up. And when dawn broke, it just stopped. Let me go. It wanted me alive. It wanted me to remember. I pulled a fresh sheet of paper toward me and started another list. Kalar Village, Afghanistan. Fallujah Sector 16, Iraq. Helmand Province Outpost, Afghanistan. Mosul Perimeter Patrol, Iraq. Timbuktu Forward Base, Mali. All places where patrols had gone missing. All with a single survivor reporting hallucinations or stress-induced delusions. All officially classified as enemy action despite lack of bodies or evidence of firefights. The military had a neat explanation for each one. Insurgents, terrorists, local militia, bodies removed by enemy forces, survivors suffering from combat stress. I knew better now. When I'd first started looking into these cases, I'd been desperate for validation, proof I wasn't crazy. Now I was looking for patterns, connections, anything that might help me understand what that thing was and why it let me live. My laptop chimed with an email notification. I'd been reaching out to families of soldiers lost in similar incidents. Most never replied. Some sent angry responses telling me to leave them alone with their grief, but occasionally someone would respond with information the official reports left out. This email was from Warren's parents. Raiden Warren, 22 years old, farm kid from Nebraska. Quiet, reliable, always had your back. I clicked open the message, and my throat tightened. Staff Sergeant Bowen, thank you for reaching out about our son. We've attached some of Raiden's last letters home. We don't understand everything he wrote in them, but maybe they'll help you find peace. We're still looking for ours. The Warrens. I downloaded the attachment with shaking hands. Three scanned handwritten letters dated in the weeks before our final patrol. The first two were typical, base life, missing home, looking forward to leave. The third, written just three days before Kalar, made my blood run cold. Been seeing strange things at night. Kyle thinks it's nothing, but I swear something watches us from the shadows. Last night on perimeter check, I saw a tall figure by the village edge. When I looked through my scope, it was gone. The locals have been acting strange too. The village has been getting quieter every day. Some of the guys think they're planning something, but it feels different. It feels like they're scared. Maybe they know something we don't. I pushed back from the table so hard my chair toppled over. He had seen it before we ever set foot in Kalar. Raiden had seen that thing watching us, and I hadn't known. He'd noticed the village growing quieter, just like we found it that night, completely abandoned. If I'd known, if he'd reported it to me instead of just mentioning it in a letter home, but I knew that wasn't fair. Would I have believed him? Would I have reported to command that one of my men was seeing shadows? Or would I have told him to get more sleep and stop letting his imagination run wild? I picked up my chair and sat back down, hands trembling as I reread the letter. There was more. Sergeant Bowen keeps us focused, good leader. Makes me feel like whatever happens, we'll handle it. Patrol through Kalar coming up. Standard sweep, nothing special. Should be routine. The words hit me like a physical blow. Raiden had trusted me. They all had. I was supposed to bring them home. I looked around my empty apartment at the papers scattered across my table, evidence of months of obsessive research while the rest of the world moved on. The man Raiden described in that letter, the confident leader who made his squad feel safe, that man died in Kalar Village along with Kyle, Raiden, Marvin, Randy, and Jorge. The man who came back was someone else entirely, someone haunted, someone no one believed, someone who woke up screaming night after night hearing the voices of dead men through a radio that shouldn't work. I opened my laptop and created a new document. At the top, I typed \"Full Account of Events at Kalar Village, Afghanistan.\" Below that, Staff Sergeant Edward Bowen, 10th Mountain Division. The cursor blinked at me. I needed to get it all down, everything I remembered, everything I'd learned since. The medication was making my memories fuzzy around the edges. Some mornings I woke up and couldn't remember if Kyle had been on point or if it had been Marvin. Some nights the village streets in my nightmares looked different than I remembered them.I needed to document it all before those memories faded completely. The empty village, the tall figure in the coat, the way bullets passed through it, the radio that broadcast their voices even, the radio that broadcast their voices even after I'd thrown it away. The way the village seemed to shift around us. Streets appearing that weren't on any map. Buildings growing taller and more twisted. The thing with no face, just darkness where features should be. I began typing, slowly at first, then faster as the memories flowed. I described our equipment check before the patrol. Kyle's nervousness with his night vision goggles. Raiden counting his ammunition for the third time. I detailed our entry into the village. The unnatural silence, the abandoned market stalls with goods still laid out as if everyone had vanished mid-transaction. I wrote about Kyle firing at a figure I couldn't see, about finding nothing in that alley, about Raiden falling behind, talking to himself, seeing movement at the edge of his vision. My fingers trembled as I typed about Randy being thrown against that wall, about Marvin emptying his magazine into a figure that didn't even flinch as bullets passed through it. About the thing dissolving at its edges like smoke, disappearing and reappearing closer to us. I documented Jorge's scream over the radio, Marvin's final transmission cut short, Kyle hiding in that drainage ditch, terrified beyond rational thought. The chase through streets that shouldn't exist. Kyle frozen in the street, the thing looming behind him. Then Kyle collapsing untouched. The words poured out of me, filling page after page. I included everything the official report left out, everything that made my account unreliable, according to Dr. Winters. When I reached the part about dawn breaking as I stumbled out of the village, I paused. My shoulders ached from hunching over the keyboard for hours. The sky outside my window was beginning to lighten. I continued typing, adding what I'd learned since that night, the other incidents I'd uncovered, the patterns, the way military officials dismissed connections between cases as coincidence, Raiden's letters mentioning the strange figure days before our patrol. As I finished, I sat back and looked at what I'd written. 23 pages. The complete truth as best as I could remember it. Not the sanitized version in the official report about a Taliban ambush with bodies removed. Not Dr. Winters' version about stress-induced hallucinations and survivor's guilt. The real story of what happened to five good men who deserved better than to be written off as casualties of a war against human enemies. I saved the document, then created a backup on a flash drive, then another. I couldn't risk losing this. My phone buzzed again. Another text from Dr. Winters. \"Your appointment is in two hours. Please confirm you're coming.\" I texted back, \"I'll be there.\" I would go. I would let them think their treatment was working. I would nod and agree that my delusions were stress induced, that with time and medication, I would come to accept the reality of what happened, but I knew the truth. And now, I had a record of it, not just in my increasingly unreliable memory, but in black and white. Something solid I could hold onto as the medications tried to blur the edges of what I knew. I printed the document and slipped it into a folder along with copies of the incident reports I'd gathered and Raiden's letters. Then I hid the folder inside a hollowed out military history book on my shelf, a place no one would think to look. As the printer hummed with the last few pages, I caught myself listening for voices, the whispered pleas of my squad that sometimes came through unplugged radios and silent phones. But this morning, there was only the quiet of my apartment and the soft whir of the printer. I knew they would come again though, in dreams, through electronics, in the moments between sleeping and waking. The voices of men who had trusted me to lead them safely through a routine patrol in an empty village. I wouldn't forget them. I wouldn't let their stories be rewritten. And someday I would find answers about what really happened in Kellar Village, about what that thing was, why it had taken my men, and why it had deliberately left me alive to remember."
