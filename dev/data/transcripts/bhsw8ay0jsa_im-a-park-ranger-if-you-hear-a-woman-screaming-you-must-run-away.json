  "full_text": "I was three lines into the incident report when Jasper's voice cut through the static on my radio, high-pitched and strained in a way that made me stop writing mid-sentence. \"Julian, I need backup at the Blackwood Trailhead. We've got a situation.\" The clock on the wall read 3:47. I'd been looking forward to finishing these reports and heading home early for once, maybe grilling something decent for dinner instead of microwaving another frozen meal. But something in Jasper's tone killed that plan immediately. In the six months since he'd been assigned to my sector, I'd never heard him sound like that. Not nervous, which was normal for him, but genuinely rattled. I picked up the radio. \"What's the nature of the situation?\" \"There's a woman screaming for help deep in the woods, maybe half a mile past the main trail marker. She sounds... she sounds really hurt, Julian.\" Standard missing hiker protocol, probably someone who'd wandered off the marked path and gotten themselves injured. It happened more often than people wanted to admit, especially this time of year when the weather was still decent but the days were getting shorter. \"Copy that. Any visual on the subject?\" \"Negative. I can hear her but I can't see her. She's too far into the tree line.\" I waited for him to continue with the standard details, approximate age from voice analysis, direction of travel, whether he'd attempted verbal contact. Instead, the radio went quiet for several seconds. When Jasper's voice came back, it was quieter, more uncertain. \"Julian, something's not right about this.\" That phrase hit me differently than it should have. \"Not right how?\" I wanted to ask, but something in his delivery made me hesitate. Jasper was young, inexperienced, prone to overthinking situations that had simple explanations, but he wasn't the type to call for backup unless he genuinely needed it. In six months, he'd only requested assistance twice, both times for legitimate emergencies. \"Explain not right,\" I said. Another pause. \"I don't know how to explain it. Just can you get out here, please?\" The please sealed it. I set down my pen and reached for my gear. \"On my way. Maintain your position and keep monitoring the situation. Do not attempt contact until I arrive.\" \"Copy that.\" I grabbed my rifle from the gun safe, checked the chamber out of habit, and slung it across my shoulder. The weight of it felt heavier than usual though I couldn't figure out why. Probably just the thought of hiking into dense woods to extract an injured civilian. Those situations always carried risk, unstable terrain, potential for additional injuries, the constant worry that you were making the wrong call about how to move someone safely. The drive to Blackwood took 18 minutes, and I spent most of it running through possibilities. Lost day hiker was the most likely scenario. Maybe someone who'd tried to take photos off the main trail and slipped down a slope. The screaming suggested serious injury, broken leg maybe, or a fall that had left them trapped somewhere. Jasper's unease was probably just inexperience amplifying a standard rescue situation into something more dramatic than it actually was. But that phrase kept echoing in my head, \"Something's not right about this.\" I'd used those exact words myself once 15 years ago during my second month as a ranger. Different park, different state, but the same job, the same responsibility to respond when people needed help in the wilderness. That situation had started with a radio call too, though it had been my partner who'd received it, not me. I'd been the rookie then, the one asking questions and trying to understand what was happening. I pushed that memory away before it could develop into something more detailed, ancient history. Whatever was happening today in the Blackwood section was a completely separate incident with completely different circumstances. The Blackwood trailhead sat at the end of a gravel road that wound through dense pine forest for about two miles before opening into a small parking area. Jasper's patrol vehicle was the only one there, parked at an angle that suggested he'd arrived quickly and hadn't bothered with precise positioning. I pulled up next to him and killed the engine. He was standing beside his truck, radio in one hand, the other hand fidgeting with his belt buckle. Even from a distance, I could see the tension in his posture, shoulders rigid, weight shifting from foot to foot. When he saw me approaching, relief flooded his face in a way that made me realize he'd been more shaken than his radio calls had indicated. \"Thank God you're here,\" he said. \"It's been going on for over an hour now.\" \"The screaming?\" \"Yeah. Same spot, same... same everything. She keeps calling for help, but it never changes, never moves.\" I studied his face. Jasper was 24, blond, built like he'd played college sports before deciding on a career in park service. Normally, he had the kind of easy confidence that came from being young and physically capable. Right now, he looked like he'd seen something that had fundamentally altered his understanding of the world. \"Walk me through it from the beginning,\" I said. \"I was doing the afternoon patrol, checking the trail markers and making sure the fire warning signs were still posted properly. Got to the main marker around 2:30, and that's when I first heard it. Woman's voice, calling for help. Sounded like she was in real distress.\" Standard protocol would've been for him to call it in immediately and request backup before investigating.The fact that he'd waited over an hour suggested he'd tried to handle it himself first, probably spent time trying to locate the source of the voice. \"Did you attempt to make contact?\" \"I called out, asked her to keep talking so I could find her. But she just kept repeating the same thing, 'Help me, please help me, I'm hurt. Please help me.'\" Over and over, same words, same tone, same rhythm. The way he described it made something cold settle in my stomach. Injured people didn't usually repeat themselves with that kind of consistency. Pain and fear made speech erratic, desperate, variable. Someone who was genuinely hurt would be providing information, where they were, what had happened, how badly they were injured. \"You said it never moves?\" \"That's the thing that's bothering me most. I've been standing here for over an hour and the voice is always coming from the exact same location. If someone's really hurt, they'd be trying to get closer to the trail, right? Or at least shifting position, trying to get more comfortable. But this, it's like she's stuck in one spot, saying the same thing over and over.\" I look toward the tree line. The Blackwood section was dense forest, mostly pine and oak, with thick undergrowth that made navigation difficult even during daylight. Sound carried strangely in that kind of environment. Voices could seem closer or farther than they actually were, and the direction could be deceptive depending on wind and terrain. But Jasper's description was bothering me for reasons I didn't want to examine too closely. \"Can you hear it now?\" \"Not right now. It comes and goes. Maybe every 10 or 15 minutes she'll call out for a few minutes, then go quiet again.\" As if on cue, a woman's voice drifted through the trees, distant, but clear enough to make out the words. \"Help me. Please, someone help me. I'm hurt.\" The voice was definitely female, probably middle-aged based on the tone. It carried the kind of desperation that suggested serious injury and genuine fear. But as I listened, I started to understand what had unsettled Jasper. There was something mechanical about it, something too consistent. The pauses between words were identical each time. The inflection never varied. \"'Help me, please. Someone help me. I'm hurt.' Exactly the same. Not similar, identical.\" The cold weight in my stomach got heavier. \"How long has she been repeating those exact words?\" \"Since I got here, same thing every time.\" Jasper looked at me with eyes that were asking me to explain something he couldn't understand himself. \"'Julian, people don't talk like that when they're really hurt, do they?'\" I wanted to tell him he was overthinking it, that stress and injury could cause people to repeat themselves, that we needed to focus on getting to her location and providing assistance. But I couldn't make myself say any of those things because I knew he was right. People didn't talk like that when they were really hurt. 15 years ago in a different park, I'd heard something similar. A man's voice that time, calling for help with the same mechanical consistency, the same perfect repetition. My partner had insisted we investigate, despite my growing certainty that something was fundamentally wrong with the situation. We'd found the source of the voice eventually. We'd also found what was making it. I looked at Jasper's pale face and realized he could sense it too, even without experience to give him context. Some part of him understood that what we were hearing wasn't quite human, even if he couldn't articulate why. The voice called out again, identical to before, and I felt 15 years of carefully suppressed memories trying to surface. I grabbed my rifle and checked the safety. \"Stay close to me and do exactly what I tell you. We're going to find her.\" The trail disappeared almost immediately once we entered the Blackwood section. What started as a clear path quickly dissolved into barely visible deer tracks winding between thick stands of pine and oak. Jasper walked ahead of me. His shoulders tense, checking over his shoulder every few steps like he expected something to follow us. The forest floor was soft underfoot, decades of fallen leaves creating a natural carpet that muffled our footsteps. I kept my rifle ready but not raised, safety off, finger near the trigger guard. The weight of it felt familiar in my hands after all these years. My eyes moved constantly, scanning the tree line, checking the spaces between trunks where shadows gathered thick and dark. The afternoon light filtered down through the canopy in scattered patches, creating a patchwork of brightness and gloom that made it hard to judge distances. Jasper's radio crackled softly on his belt, the static barely audible, but present. He'd turned the volume down when we started walking, not wanting to broadcast our position to whatever might be out here. Smart thinking for a rookie. Most new rangers would've kept it loud, thinking they might need to call for backup quickly. But Jasper understood that sometimes the thing you're tracking might be tracking you back. The air was still between the trees, no wind to speak of. That made every sound carry farther than it should. I could hear Jasper's breathing slightly faster than normal, could hear the soft scrape of his boots against fallen branches.... could hear the distant chatter of squirrels somewhere off to our left going about their business like nothing was wrong. We'd been walking maybe 20 minutes when I started thinking about the timeline Jasper had given me. An hour of screaming, then 10 minutes of silence before I arrived, then another 20 minutes for me to get here and for us to hike in. That meant we were looking at nearly an hour and a half since the woman had supposedly stopped calling for help. If someone was genuinely hurt, genuinely trapped, they might have passed out by now, might have given up hope of rescue, or might have died from whatever injuries they'd sustained. But my gut told me we weren't going to find an injured hiker. The memories from 15 years ago kept pushing at the edges of my mind. Different forest, different season, but the same feeling of wrongness that Jasper had picked up on. The same sense that something was pretending to be human and doing a poor job of it. I'd been young then, eager to help, convinced that my training and good intentions were enough to handle whatever the job threw at me. I'd learned better. Jasper stopped suddenly ahead of me, his hand going up in a gesture I recognized. He'd heard something. I froze in place, listening, trying to filter out the normal forest sounds and focus on whatever had caught his attention. Then I heard it. \"Help me! Please! Someone help me!\" The voice came from deeper in the woods, maybe another quarter mile ahead of us. Female, definitely distressed. Words clear despite the distance. But even as I registered the content of the plea, my brain was already analyzing the delivery, the tone, the rhythm, the way the syllables carried through the trees. 30 seconds passed. I counted them off in my head, watching the second hand on my watch. \"Help me! Please, someone help me!\" Identical, not just similar, not just close. Identical in every way. Same inflection on help, same desperate rise in pitch on please, same trailing off on me at the end. Same duration, same volume, same everything. Jasper turned to look at me, his face pale. He'd heard it too. Heard what was wrong with it even if he couldn't put it into words yet. His eyes were wide, asking questions he probably didn't want answered. I raised my hand, palm out, signaling him to stay quiet and still. We stood there in the dappled light, waiting, listening. I kept my eyes on my watch, counting down. 28 seconds, 29, 30. \"Help me! Please, someone help me!\" Perfect repetition, like a recording being played on loop. Like someone had captured a moment of genuine terror and was broadcasting it at regular intervals to draw in anyone foolish enough to respond. Jasper's mouth opened slightly, probably to ask what we should do. But I caught his eye and shook my head firmly. Sound carried in these woods. If something was out there mimicking human distress, it might be listening for our response, waiting to hear how many people had come to investigate. I motioned for Jasper to come closer, close enough that I could whisper directly into his ear without the sound traveling. He moved carefully, avoiding the larger branches on the ground, his boots finding the soft spots between the roots. When he was within arm's reach, I leaned in. \"Count the intervals,\" I breathed, my voice barely audible even to myself. \"Listen to the exact words.\" He nodded, understanding immediately. We waited together, both of us focused on the voice that continued to call out from the deeper woods. I watched Jasper's face as he began to pick up on what had unsettled him earlier, what his instincts had recognized before his conscious mind could process it. 30 seconds. \"Help me! Please, someone help me!\" 30 seconds. \"Help me! Please, someone help me!\" 30 seconds. \"Help me! Please, someone help me!\" Jasper's breathing got shallower. I could see him working through the implications, trying to reconcile what he was hearing with what he knew about human behavior. People in genuine distress didn't repeat themselves with mechanical precision. They varied their pleas, changed their words, got hoarse from shouting, moved around trying to find better positions to be heard from. This wasn't human. I leaned close to his ear again. \"We're not dealing with a person in distress.\" The words came out flat and certain, carrying the weight of experience Jasper didn't have yet. His head snapped toward me, confusion clear in his expression. He wanted to ask questions, wanted explanations, wanted reassurance that we were still operating in the normal world, where the worst thing we might encounter was a lost hiker with a broken leg. \"What do you mean?\" He whispered back, his voice tight with the kind of fear that came from realizing you were out of your depth. I studied his face, seeing myself at 24. Seeing the moment when everything you thought you knew about the job shifted into something darker and more complicated. Part of me wanted to protect him from it, send him back to the truck while I handled this alone. But he'd already heard too much, seen too much. And if we were dealing with what I thought we were dealing with, I might need backup. The screaming continued from ahead of us. That perfect 30-second rhythm that no human throat could maintain. Each repetition sounded exactly like the last. No variation in tone or timing.... no sign of the fatigue that should have set in after nearly two hours of calling for help. I kept my voice low, barely a whisper. \"Listen to it. Really listen. When people are hurt, scared, desperate, they don't sound like that. They don't repeat the same words in the same way over and over. Their voices change. They get tired. They try different approaches.\" Jasper's eyes widened as the implications sank in. I could see him replaying the last hour in his mind, all the time he'd spent listening to those calls, all the details that had felt wrong without him being able to identify why. \"Then what is it?\" he asked, and I heard the tremor in his voice that meant he was starting to understand we'd moved beyond normal ranger protocols. Before I could answer, the voice called out again, that same mechanical repetition echoing through the trees. But this time, I caught something else underneath it. A rustling in the undergrowth, maybe 50 yards closer than the voice. Something moving parallel to our position, staying hidden in the thick brush. Whatever was making those sounds knew we were here, and it was positioning itself between us and the way out. I needed to tell him. Jasper was looking at me with that expression rookies get when they realize their training manual doesn't cover what's happening. The mechanical voice echoed again from deeper in the woods, and I could hear whatever was moving through the brush adjusting its position, getting closer. \"15 years ago,\" I said, keeping my voice low, \"I was where you are now. Rookie ranger, second month on the job.\" Jasper's eyes widened slightly. He was still gripping his radio, knuckles white against the black plastic casing. I could see him trying to process what I was telling him while that thing continued its 30-second countdown in the distance. \"I got a call just before my shift ended. Hikers reported hearing someone screaming for help in this exact section of forest. Same area we're standing in right now.\" The memory came back sharp and clear, bringing with it the taste of copper and the smell of pine needles mixed with something else, something wrong. Five people had gone missing. A group from the university doing some kind of research project. I shifted my rifle to a more comfortable position, finger still resting near the trigger guard. The undergrowth rustled again, maybe 40 yards away now. Whatever was out there was patient, methodical, just like before. \"The witnesses said they heard the screams around noon. By the time I got the call, it was almost 4:00 in the afternoon. But when I arrived with my partner, we could still hear them. Same voice, same words, same timing.\" I paused, watching Jasper's face. He was starting to understand that this wasn't going to be a normal rescue operation. \"We spent three hours out here that day. The voice never stopped, never changed, never moved.\" Jasper swallowed hard. \"What happened to the hikers?\" \"Never found them. Search teams combed this area for two weeks. Brought in dogs, helicopters, volunteers from three counties. Nothing. No bodies, no equipment, no trace they'd ever been here.\" I could still remember the frustration in the search coordinator's voice after the first week. \"How do five people just disappear without leaving a single footprint?\" The voice called out again, that same mechanical plea drifting through the trees. \"Help me. Please help me.\" Jasper flinched at the sound, his whole body tensing. I put a hand on his shoulder, feeling the tremor running through his muscles. \"But you heard the screams,\" he said, \"just like now.\" \"Just like now.\" I nodded toward the sound. \"Same pattern, same timing. My partner thought we were dealing with someone who was injured, maybe delirious. Kept insisting we had to find them before dark.\" I remembered Tom Martinez, 20-year veteran with commendations covering half his office wall. He'd been so certain we could track down the source, so confident in his experience, right up until we found what was making the noise. We followed the sound deeper into the forest. Took us almost an hour to get close enough to see what was happening. The rustling in the brush moved again, and I caught a glimpse of something dark shifting between the tree trunks. Not an animal. Animals move differently, with purpose and natural rhythm. This was something else entirely. Jasper was breathing faster now, short, shallow breaths that would tire him out if he didn't get control. \"What did you find?\" I didn't answer immediately. The memory was there, clear as yesterday, but talking about it would make it real again. Would bring back the smell and the sight and the sound Tom made when he saw what was hanging from that branch. \"We need to keep moving,\" I said instead. \"Stay behind me. Keep your rifle ready. And whatever happens, don't run toward the voice, no matter what you hear, no matter what it sounds like.\" \"Julian.\" Jasper's voice had an edge to it now. \"What did you find 15 years ago?\" The voice called out again, and this time, I was sure it was closer, maybe 300 yards instead of four. It was moving, drawing us deeper into the woods, just like it had drawn Tom and me, just like it had probably drawn those five hikers. \"We found where the screams were coming from,\" I said finally. \"And we found what happened to the hikers. What was left of them.\"I started walking toward the sound, rifle held low but ready. Jasper fell into step behind me. His boots crunching on the pine needles and dried leaves. The trees seemed to close in around us as we moved deeper into the forest. Branches forming a canopy so thick that the afternoon light barely penetrated. \"The thing making those sounds,\" I continued. \"It wasn't human, wasn't an animal either. Something else. Something that had learned to copy human voices but couldn't quite get the emotions right. That's why the screams sound so mechanical, so repetitive.\" \"How do you know?\" Jasper's voice was barely above a whisper. \"Because I've heard it before. Because Tom and I tracked it down and found its feeding ground.\" The words came out harder than I intended. \"Because I've spent 15 years hoping I'd never hear those sounds again.\" We walked in silence for several minutes, following a deer trail that wound between massive pine trunks. The voice continued its countdown, 30 seconds of silence followed by that same plea for help. I counted the intervals automatically, a habit left over from that day with Tom. \"32 seconds, 31, 33. Always close to 30, but never exactly the same.\" Whatever was making the sound had some variation built in, just enough to seem almost human. The rustling in the brush had stopped. That worried me more than the noise had. It meant the thing was either very close or it moved far enough ahead to set up an ambush. Neither option was good. \"What happened to your partner?\" Jasper asked. \"Tom retired the next week, put in his papers and moved to Florida. Told everyone he wanted to be closer to his grandkids, but I knew better.\" I stepped over a fallen log, testing each footfall before putting my full weight down. The ground was soft here, covered in years of decomposed leaves, perfect for hiding tracks. \"He couldn't handle what we saw. Couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Kept hearing those screams in his head.\" \"But you stayed.\" \"Someone had to. Someone who knew what to look for.\" I glanced back at Jasper. His face was pale, but he was keeping up, staying alert. Good. We were going to need every advantage we could get. \"I transferred to a different station for a few years. Told myself it was a one-time thing, some kind of freak occurrence. But I kept hearing stories, missing hikers, unexplained disappearances, search teams finding nothing but hearing voices in the woods.\" The voice called out again, definitely closer now, maybe 200 yards. We were getting near the clearing where Tom and I had found the feeding ground. I could feel it in the way the trees were spaced, the way the undergrowth was starting to thin out. \"I came back here five years ago,\" I said. \"Requested a transfer back to Pine Ridge specifically so I could keep an eye on this section of forest because I knew it would come back eventually. They always do.\" \"'They?' 'There's more than one. Has to be. Too many disappearances over too wide an area for it to be just a single creature.'\" I raised my rifle slightly. Safety still off, finger moving closer to the trigger. \"But this one, the one making those sounds right now, this is the same one Tom and I encountered. I'm sure of it.\" We crested a small rise, and I could see the clearing ahead through the trees. Circular space maybe 50 yards across, surrounded by pines that had to be at least 100 years old. Massive trunks, branches starting 20 feet up, creating a natural cathedral effect. Beautiful, if you didn't know what it was used for. \"How can you be sure?\" Jasper was whispering now, instinctively understanding that we were close to something dangerous. \"Because it's using the same feeding ground. Same location, same hunting pattern. These things are territorial, like big cats. They find a spot that works and they stick with it.\" I stopped at the edge of the tree line, studying the clearing. The voice was coming from somewhere on the far side, hidden in the shadows beneath the largest pine. \"And because I can smell it.\" The odor was faint but unmistakable. Sweet and rotten, like fruit left too long in the sun mixed with something metallic. Blood and decay and something else, something alien that made my skin crawl. Jasper caught the scent a moment later. I heard him gag slightly, then force himself to swallow. \"What is that smell?\" \"Decomposition. Old kills.\" I pointed toward the center of the clearing. \"Look at the ground.\" The forest floor was wrong. Instead of the normal carpet of pine needles and fallen leaves, the earth was dark and stained. Patches of discolored soil formed rough circles, some old and faded, others more recent. Feeding spots. Places where the thing had brought its prey to consume them. \"Jesus,\" Jasper breathed. The voice called out again, and this time I could pinpoint the location. Definitely coming from the massive pine on the far side of the clearing, the one with branches thick enough to support significant weight, just like 15 years ago. \"Stay close,\" I whispered. \"Don't look up until I tell you to. And whatever you see, don't run. Running triggers their hunting instinct.\"... we stepped into the clearing and immediately, I felt exposed. The canopy opened up here, allowing shafts of late afternoon sunlight to filter down through the branches. Our shadows stretched long across the stained ground. Dark shapes moving toward the source of the voice. The smell got stronger as we approached the center of the clearing. Jasper was breathing through his mouth now, trying to avoid the worst of it. I could hear him fighting his gag reflex with each step. The voice called out again, so close now that it seemed to be coming from directly above us. \"Help me. Please help me.\" The same words, the same inflection, but louder. Much louder. I stopped and grabbed Jasper's arm, pulling him to a halt just as he started to look up toward the sound. \"Don't,\" I said firmly. \"Not yet.\" But I could see it in my peripheral vision, a shape hanging from the thick branch 15 feet above us, suspended by something that wasn't rope. A woman's body impaled through the midsection on a broken branch that had been sharpened to a point. Her torso was completely hollow, emptied out with surgical precision. Ribs spread wide. Internal organs removed so cleanly that barely any blood had dripped to the ground below. The same thing Tom and I had found 15 years ago. The same feeding method, the same display. A lure and a warning combined into one horrific tableau. The sound hit the forest floor before I could process what was happening. Jasper doubled over, his hands braced against his knees, and everything he'd eaten that day came up in violent heaves against the base of a massive pine. The retching echoed through the clearing, harsh and raw, cutting through the unnatural silence that had settled over this place. I kept my rifle ready and swept my eyes across the tree line, tracking every shadow, every branch that might conceal movement. The mechanical voice had cut off the instant we'd stepped into this clearing like someone had flipped a switch. That wasn't coincidence. Whatever had been calling to us knew we were here now, had probably known the moment we'd started moving through the forest. The sudden silence felt heavier than the repetitive screaming had been, loaded with the kind of tension that made every nerve in my body fire warning signals. Jasper spat and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, his face pale and slick with sweat. He was shaking, and I couldn't blame him. The first time you see what one of these things does to a person, it changes something fundamental in how you understand the world. I remembered Tom's reaction 15 years ago had been similar, though he'd managed to keep his breakfast down until we'd gotten back to the truck. The sight above us was worse than what we'd found back then, more deliberate in its presentation. This wasn't just feeding behavior. This was a display. The forest around us felt wrong in ways that went beyond the obvious horror suspended in the branches. The normal sounds were missing. No bird calls, no insects, no small animals moving through the undergrowth. Even the wind seemed muted here, as if the air itself was holding its breath. The only sound was Jasper's ragged breathing as he tried to pull himself together, and the faint creak of tree branches overhead that I was trying very hard not to think about. I positioned myself so I could watch both the tree line and keep Jasper in my peripheral vision. He was vulnerable right now, and if this thing decided to make a move, I needed to be ready. My finger stayed near the trigger guard, not quite on it, but close enough that I could react in a fraction of a second. The rifle felt solid in my hands, familiar weight that provided some small comfort in a situation that had moved far beyond normal ranger protocols. Jasper straightened up slowly using the tree trunk for support. His uniform was wrinkled and stained, and his hands were still trembling. He looked at me with wide eyes that held too much white around the edges, the kind of expression you see on people who've just had their fundamental assumptions about reality shattered. \"What is that thing?\" He whispered, his voice hoarse from being sick. Before I could answer, the voice came again. From somewhere in the trees to our left, maybe 30 yards away, hidden in the thick canopy where the afternoon shadows created perfect concealment. The same woman's voice, the same words we'd been hearing for the past hour. \"Help me. Please help me.\" But now that we were close enough, now that I wasn't distracted by trying to track the source through dense forest, I could hear what Jasper had sensed from the beginning. The words carried no weight, no emotional resonance. They were perfect in their pronunciation, exact in their timing, but completely hollow, like listening to a recording of someone reading phonetically from a script in a language they didn't understand. Real human distress has texture to it. Fear makes voices crack and waver. Pain changes breathing patterns, affects how sounds are formed. Genuine pleas for help carry desperation that you can feel in your chest, an urgency that makes you want to move, to respond, to help. This voice had none of that. It was technically accurate, but emotionally void, the vocal equivalent of a photograph that looked right until you notice the eyes were just a little too flat, a little too empty. I felt something cold settle in my stomach as the implications hit me fully.This thing had been using the woman's voice for hours before we'd arrived. It had probably started the moment she'd died, maybe even before that was complete. The thought of what she might have experienced in her final moments, knowing something was learning to copy her voice while she was still alive to hear it, made my jaw clench tight enough that my teeth ached. \"Jasper,\" I said quietly, keeping my voice low and steady. \"The thing that did this to her is still here, still watching us.\" His eyes went even wider, if that was possible. He looked around the clearing with jerky, panicked movements that made me want to grab him and force him to be still. Sudden movements were exactly what we couldn't afford right now. \"Where?\" he whispered. \"Somewhere close. Close enough to see us, close enough to know we found its display.\" I kept my own movements minimal, just small adjustments to my stance that let me cover different angles without telegraphing my intentions. \"It's using her voice to try to lure us closer, probably into whatever trap it's got prepared.\" The voice came again, same location, same timing. \"Help me. Please help me.\" Jasper flinched at the sound and I saw his hand drift toward his sidearm. I shook my head slightly, catching his attention. \"Don't draw unless I tell you to,\" I said. \"And don't respond to the voice. Don't call back. Don't try to answer it. That's what it wants.\" \"I don't understand,\" Jasper said, his voice barely audible. \"What is it?\" I had to choose my words carefully. Too much information too fast, and he might panic completely. Too little, and he might make a mistake that got us both killed. The thing was, I wasn't entirely sure I understood it myself. Tom and I had theorized plenty after our encounter 15 years ago, but we'd never had solid answers, just observations and guesswork based on one terrifying night in these same woods. \"It's something that's learned to copy human voices,\" I said. \"Probably learned by listening to people when they're...\" I gestured vaguely toward the tree above us. \"When they're in distress. But it doesn't understand what the words mean, doesn't understand human emotions. So, when it tries to use those voices, they come out wrong. Flat, mechanical.\" \"How do you know all this?\" \"Because Tom and I tracked one down 15 years ago. Same area, same hunting pattern, same kind of display.\" I watched the shadows between the trees, looking for any hint of movement. \"The voice is just a tool to it, like a fishing lure. It calls until something comes to investigate, then it takes them.\" The voice repeated again, and this time, I was ready for it. I listened carefully to the tone, the inflection, the precise way each syllable was formed. It was definitely the same woman whose body was suspended above us. The vocal patterns matched what I could remember of her brief genuine screams from when we'd first entered the clearing. But stripped of all the human elements that made speech more than just sound, it became something deeply unsettling. Jasper was starting to understand. I could see it in his face. The color was coming back slowly and his breathing was getting steadier. Good. I needed him functional if we were going to get out of this intact. \"So, what do we do?\" he asked. That was the question I'd been dreading. Tom and I had gotten lucky 15 years ago. We'd found the creature's feeding ground during daylight hours when it was less active, and we'd had the element of surprise. This time felt different, more deliberate. The positioning of the body, the timing of our arrival, the way the voice had stopped and started again, this felt like we were being herded, manipulated into being exactly where we were standing. \"We stay calm,\" I said. \"We don't give it what it wants, and we watch for our chance to move.\" The voice came again from the left, but this time, I caught something else. A faint rustling in the canopy, branches moving in a pattern that didn't match the barely perceptible wind. Something large was repositioning itself up there, moving with deliberate care to stay hidden while maintaining line of sight on our position. I thought about the woman above us, about how precisely her body had been emptied and displayed. This thing was intelligent, patient, and utterly alien in its approach to hunting. It didn't just kill for food. It killed for the tools that death provided. Voices to call with, fear to feed on, bodies to use as bait for the next victim. The clearing felt smaller now, more enclosed. What had seemed like open space when we'd first entered now felt like a carefully constructed killing floor, with every sight line planned, every escape route anticipated. We were standing exactly where this thing wanted us to be. \"Help me. Please help me,\" the voice called again, and I finally understood why it sounded so wrong beyond just the lack of emotion. The woman was dead. Her throat was gone. Her vocal cords destroyed or removed. The sound wasn't coming from any human anatomy at all. It was being produced by something that had learned to mimic the mechanics of human speech without needing any of the physical structures that normally created it. Human voices came from breath moving through shaped passages, from tongue and teeth and lips working together.This was something else entirely, something that could reproduce the end result without any of the underlying process. No wonder it sounded flat and mechanical. It was artificial from the ground up, a perfect copy with no original source. I whispered to Jasper, keeping my voice as quiet as possible while still making sure he could hear me clearly. \"The thing that killed her is still nearby. It's using her voice, but it can't replicate emotions. Can't understand what fear or pain actually sound like. That's why the calls sound so wrong.\" He nodded, and I could see him processing this information, filing it away in whatever mental framework he was building to deal with this situation. Good. Understanding the enemy was the first step toward surviving it. Jasper straightened up from the tree, dragging the back of his hand across his mouth. His face had gone completely white, but he managed to get his rifle up and into position. The barrel wavered as his hands shook, and I could hear his breathing coming in short uneven bursts. \"What are we dealing with here?\" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. I kept my own rifle ready, continuing to scan the tree line while I considered how much to tell him. The truth was I'd never gotten a clear look at the thing during that encounter 15 years ago. Tom and I had tracked it to this same clearing, found the same kind of display hanging in the branches. But when it finally showed itself, everything had happened too fast. Too much chaos, too much fear clouding our judgment. What I remembered was movement through the trees that didn't make sense, something tall enough that its head would have been level with branches that were eight or nine feet off the ground. But it wasn't just the height that had been wrong. The way it moved through the forest, weaving between trunks without seeming to adjust its path, like it could bend in ways that human joints simply couldn't accommodate. Tom had fired three shots that day, and I was pretty sure at least one had connected, but the thing had just melted back into the woods like it had never been there at all. \"I don't know exactly,\" I said, keeping my voice low. \"Never got a good look at it before.\" That wasn't entirely true, but it was close enough. The glimpses I'd caught had been so brief, so impossible that I'd spent years convincing myself I'd imagined half of what I thought I'd seen. When you're pumped full of adrenaline and scared out of your mind, your brain starts filling in details that might not have been there. At least that's what I'd told myself. But there were other things I knew. Stories that had been passed down through the ranger service here, whispered conversations between the old-timers who'd worked these woods for 30 or 40 years. They talked about disappearances that went back decades, maybe longer. Always the same pattern. People venturing too deep into the remote sections, voices calling for help that went on too long, search parties that found nothing but sometimes heard those same calls echoing through the trees. Frank Morrison, who'd retired just before I transferred back here, had pulled me aside during my first week and told me about a case from the '70s. Three hunters who'd gone missing during deer season. Their truck was found at a trailhead, gear still inside, but no trace of the men themselves. The search had gone on for six days, and on the last day, the volunteers had heard someone calling for help from deep in the forest. They'd spent hours tracking the voice, but every time they got close, it seemed to move farther away. When they finally gave up and headed back, they realized the voice had been leading them in circles. \"Been taking people for generations,\" Frank had said, staring out at the tree line. \"Whatever it is, it's been here longer than any of us.\" I'd thought he was just trying to spook the new guy, but now standing in this clearing with that mechanical voice echoing through the trees, I was starting to understand that the old rangers hadn't been telling ghost stories. They'd been trying to warn me. The voice called out again, and my head snapped toward the sound. But this time, it was coming from our right, maybe 40 yards away instead of the left where we'd heard it before. \"Help me. Please, someone help me.\" Same exact tone, same inflection, same desperate pleading that somehow managed to sound completely empty of actual desperation, but the location had shifted, and it had done so without any sound of movement through the undergrowth. No footsteps, no branches breaking, no rustling of leaves. Just the voice in a new position like it had simply materialized there. My stomach dropped as I realized what was happening. The thing was circling us, trying to disorient us, make us lose track of where it actually was. It wanted us confused, wanted us spinning around in the middle of this clearing like targets in a shooting gallery. I thought about the layout of the clearing, the sight lines from the tree line to where we were standing. If something was moving around the perimeter, it would have a clear view of us from almost any angle. We were completely exposed out here, and it knew exactly where we were at all times. \"Jasper,\" I said quietly, not taking my eyes off the trees. \"Stay close to me. Keep your weapon ready, but do not respond to that voice. No matter what it says, no matter how desperate it sounds, you don't say a word back to it.\" He nodded, but I could see the fear building in his expression.This was way beyond anything they'd trained him for at the academy. Hell, it was beyond anything anyone had trained for, because officially, things like this didn't exist. \"And whatever you do,\" I continued, \"don't show any emotional reaction to it. Don't let it see that you're scared. Don't let it hear you breathing hard. These things feed on fear, and if it thinks you're panicking, it's going to press that advantage.\" The voice came again, this time from behind us. We'd been facing roughly north when we entered the clearing, and now it was calling from the south, which meant the thing had moved at least 90 degrees around our position in the span of maybe two minutes. I forced myself to turn slowly, keeping my movements deliberate and controlled. Jasper followed my lead, and I was relieved to see that he was getting his breathing under control. His hands were still shaking, but he was keeping the rifle steady enough to be useful if it came to that. The problem was, I had no idea what it coming to that would actually look like. Tom had never talked about the details of our encounter, and I'd been too shaken up at the time to form clear memories of how the thing had actually attacked. I remembered gunfire, remembered running, remembered the sound of something large crashing through the trees behind us. But the specific mechanics of how it moved, how it fought, what its vulnerabilities might be, all of that was lost in the chaos of 15 years ago. What I did know was that it was intelligent. The way it was positioning itself, the calculated use of the woman's voice, the choice of this clearing as a hunting ground, none of that was random. This thing planned its attacks, studied its prey, waited for the right moment to strike, which meant it was probably waiting for us to make a mistake, to give it an opening it could exploit. I tried to think like a predator, tried to figure out what it was looking for. Panic was probably the big one. If we started running blindly, we'd be easy targets. Separation would be another opportunity. If Jasper and I got split up, it could pick us off one at a time. And ammunition, if we started firing wildly at shadows, we'd burn through our rounds and leave ourselves defenseless when it finally decided to make its move. The voice called again, and this time, I was ready for it. Due east, maybe 35 yards out. It was definitely circling us, but the pattern wasn't random. It was moving clockwise around the clearing, taking up new positions at regular intervals, which meant I could start to predict where it would be next. I glanced up at the corpse hanging in the branches above us, and a new thought occurred to me. The woman had been killed recently, probably within the last day or two, based on the condition of the body. Which meant this thing had been active, had been hunting, and we'd walked right into its territory during a feeding cycle. But there was something else. The way the body had been displayed, the surgical precision of the wounds, the complete removal of the internal organs, that wasn't just killing for food. That was ritual behavior, maybe even artistic expression. This thing took pride in its work, took time to arrange its victims in specific ways, which suggested that it might not be in a hurry to kill us. It might want to play with us first, to savor the fear, to draw out the experience. That could work in our favor if we kept our heads and looked for an opportunity to turn the tables. The voice came from the north this time, completing a full circuit around our position. I was right about the pattern. It was moving in a clockwise direction, probably staying just inside the tree line where the shadows would provide cover. \"It's circling us,\" I whispered to Jasper. \"Clockwise pattern, staying in the trees. Next call should come from the northwest.\" He nodded, and I saw him shift his stance slightly, angling his body so he could bring his rifle to bear more quickly in that direction. Good. He was thinking tactically instead of just reacting in fear. The voice called out right where I'd predicted it would, and I felt a small surge of confidence. If I could track its movement, I might be able to anticipate its attack. The question was whether I'd have enough warning to do anything about it when the time came. My whole body went rigid when I heard the first branch snap. Not the light crack of a twig under foot, but the deep, wet sound of something thick giving way under serious weight. Whatever was moving through the trees ahead of us wasn't trying to be quiet anymore. Another snap echoed through the clearing, closer this time. Then another. The rhythm was all wrong. Too much time between each step, like whatever was making them had to think about where to place each foot, or like it was taking steps longer than anything human-sized should be able to manage. Jasper pressed against my back close enough that I could feel him shaking through both our uniforms. His breathing had gone shallow and rapid, little puffs of air that I could hear even over the sound of my own pulse hammering in my ears. I wanted to tell him to back up, give me room to maneuver, but I didn't dare make a sound. Not now. The footsteps kept coming, each one deliberate, measured, like the thing making them was in no hurry at all, like it knew we weren't going anywhere. I kept my rifle raised, finger resting on the trigger guard, trying to track the source of the sounds. The problem was the way sound carried in thick woods. Everything echoed and bounced until you couldn't tell if something was 30 feet away or 100 yards.But these footsteps weren't bouncing. They were coming straight toward us, cutting through the forest in a direct line that no animal would take. My mind raced through what I knew about the terrain ahead. Thick undergrowth between mature pines, deadfall from last winter's storms, patches of bramble that would tear up anything trying to push through. Nothing should be able to move through that mess in a straight line, especially not something heavy enough to snap branches like that, but the footsteps kept coming. Jasper's breathing was getting worse. I could feel him fighting not to hyperventilate, his chest rising and falling against my back in quick, shallow bursts. The kid was holding it together, but barely. I needed to keep him focused, keep him from doing something stupid like running or calling out. \"Easy,\" I whispered, so quiet I barely made any sound at all, just a breath of air shaped into a word. The footsteps stopped. Complete silence settled over the clearing. Not the normal quiet of a forest where you could still hear birds in the distance or wind through leaves, but the absolute dead silence that happens when every living thing goes into hiding. Even the insects had stopped buzzing. I waited, rifle trained on the treeline where the sounds had been coming from. Seconds stretched into what felt like minutes. My arm started to ache from holding the weapon steady, but I didn't dare shift position. Whatever was out there was listening now, trying to pinpoint exactly where we were. Then I heard it again. One careful step, closer than before, then another. But now I could tell the spacing was wrong in a way that made my skin crawl. The time between footsteps was too long, like each step covered more ground than should be possible, like whatever was making them had legs that were just too long for anything that should exist. Jasper made a small sound in his throat, barely audible, but I felt him tense up even more. He'd figured out what I was realizing, that whatever was coming toward us wasn't moving like anything we'd ever encountered before. Another step. Closer. I could hear smaller branches and undergrowth being pushed aside now, the sound of something large forcing its way through obstacles that should've made it change direction. But it kept coming in that same straight line, like the thick brush wasn't even slowing it down. My mouth had gone completely dry. I tried to swallow and couldn't. 15 years ago, Tom and I had heard these same kinds of footsteps, but we'd never gotten close enough to see what was making them. Tom had fired his shots from a distance, and whatever it was had disappeared back into the deep woods. This time was different. This time, it was coming right to us. The mechanical voice had stopped calling for help. That worried me more than the approaching footsteps. The creature had been using the voice to keep our attention, to make us focus on one specific spot while it positioned itself. Now, it didn't need the distraction anymore. I could hear Jasper trying to control his breathing, taking slow, deliberate breaths through his nose. Good. The kid was scared out of his mind, but he was thinking. He understood that making noise right now could get us both killed. Another footstep, and this time, I caught a glimpse of movement through the trees. Something tall shifting between the pine trunks about 70 feet away. Too tall. Way too tall to be human. My brain tried to make sense of what I was seeing, but the proportions were all wrong. The thing took another step, and now I could see it more clearly through the gaps in the undergrowth. My first thought was that it had to be someone on stilts because nothing could naturally be that height, but the movement was too fluid, too organic. Whatever those long legs were, they were real. Jasper pressed harder against my back, and I realized he was seeing it too. His breathing had stopped altogether for a moment, then started up again in quick, panicked bursts. I wanted to reach back and steady him, but I couldn't take my hands off the rifle. The creature took another step, pushing through a patch of dense brush like it wasn't even there. Branches that should've stopped anything human-sized just bent and snapped around it. I caught another glimpse of its silhouette, and my stomach drop. My stomach dropped when I saw how wrong the proportions were. The legs were too long, the torso too narrow, like someone had taken a human form and stretched it out until it barely resembled what it was supposed to be. 60 feet away now. Close enough that I could make out more details through the trees, and every detail made it worse. The way it moved wasn't right either. Not the careful, picking-through-undergrowth that a person would do, but a kind of flowing motion that seemed to ignore the obstacles in its path. Jasper's hands grabbed the back of my uniform shirt, bunching the fabric in his fists. I could feel him trembling through the contact, but he was staying quiet. Good. Whatever training he'd gotten was holding up under pressure, even if he was scared senseless. The thing pushed through another cluster of branches, and I got my first clear look at its skin. Mottled gray and black, like old bark or diseased flesh. But it wasn't just the color that was wrong. It was the way the skin seemed to hang on the frame underneath, stretched tight in some places and loose in others like it didn't quite fit properly. My mind kept trying to rationalize what I was seeing,Maybe it was someone in a costume. Maybe it was some kind of optical illusion caused by shadows and distance. But deep down, I knew better. This was the same thing Tom and I had encountered 15 years ago, the same thing that had been taking people from these woods for decades. Fifty feet away, I could see the skeletal frame underneath that stretched skin now, visible through places where the flesh pulled tight over protruding bones. The proportions were completely inhuman, joints that bent at angles that shouldn't be possible, limbs that were too long and too thin to support that height. The creature stepped out from behind a cluster of pine trees, and I saw its face. My breath caught in my throat. I'd thought I was prepared for this moment, thought I'd steeled myself for whatever I might see. But nothing could've prepared me for the grotesque parody of human features that stared back at me across the clearing. It had eye sockets, but they were empty, black holes that seemed to go deeper than they should. No eyes, just darkness that looked like it went on forever. The nose was barely there, just two slits in the gray flesh. But it was the mouth that made my skin crawl. It stretched too wide across the skull, extending past where the corners of a human mouth should end, like someone had taken a knife and carved a smile that went too far. Jasper made a sound behind me, a tiny whimper that he couldn't quite suppress. I felt him pressing harder against my back, and I knew he was seeing the same nightmare I was. The creature stood there for a moment, perfectly still, and I realized it was studying us. Those empty eye sockets were pointed in our direction, and even though there was nothing visible in them, I could feel its attention like a physical weight. It was evaluating us, deciding what to do next. That's when I noticed what it was holding in one of its elongated hands. The woman's head dangled from fingers that were too long and had too many joints. Her eyes were closed, her face slack and pale, but the features were intact. This was the source of the voice we'd been hearing, the lure that had drawn us into the clearing. The creature had been carrying it around like some kind of tool. My stomach lurched as I understood what that meant. The thing hadn't just killed the woman. It had kept part of her, the part it needed to make the sounds that would bring more prey. The mechanical quality of the voice made sense now. It wasn't coming from a human throat at all. Somehow, this creature could make those sounds without needing the vocal cords or lungs that normally produced speech. The head swayed slightly as the creature shifted its weight, and I saw that the neck had been severed cleanly, almost surgically. No ragged edges or torn flesh. Whatever had done this had tools or claws sharp enough to cut through bone and tissue like it was nothing. Jasper's grip on my shirt tightened, and I could feel him fighting not to lose control completely. The kid was holding it together through sheer willpower, but seeing that severed head was pushing him toward his breaking point. The creature tilted its own head slightly, studying us with those empty sockets. The movement was too fluid, like its neck could bend in ways that human anatomy wouldn't allow. Everything about it was wrong. A collection of almost-human features assembled in proportions that violated every natural law I knew. I kept my rifle trained on its center mass, but I wasn't sure bullets would even slow this thing down. It was too tall, too alien, too far-removed from anything I understood. Tom had hit it 15 years ago, and it had just disappeared into the woods. What made me think I could do any better? The creature took a step closer, and I heard Jasper's breathing speed up again. Forty feet away now, close enough that I could see details I didn't want to see, the way its skin seemed to shift and move independently of the frame underneath. The way its joints bent at impossible angles. The way that grotesque mouth never quite closed all the way. It raised the severed head slightly like it was showing us a trophy. Then, impossibly, the dead woman's mouth opened. \"Help me. Please, help me.\" The voice was exactly the same as what we'd been hearing, but now I could see that it wasn't coming from the corpse at all. The creature was making the sound somehow using the head as a prop while the real voice came from somewhere else entirely. The dead woman's lips moved slightly, but the timing was off, like a badly-dubbed movie. Jasper made another small sound, and I felt him start to shake harder. Seeing the source of the voice, understanding how the creature had been manipulating us was breaking down his last reserves of control. The thing took another step closer, still holding the head like an offering, 35 feet away. Close enough that I could smell it now, the stench of decay mixed with something else, something chemical and alien that made my nose burn. Those empty eye sockets never moved away from us. It was watching, waiting, studying our reactions. This wasn't just a predator hunting for food. This was something intelligent, something that understood fear and knew how to use it as a weapon. The severed head spoke again, the same words in the same mechanical tone while the creature's impossible mouth stretched even wider.I realized it was smiling at us, enjoying our terror. Feeding on the fear it could sense radiating from both of us. I had to make a choice. Wait for it to come closer and hope I could get a clean shot or take the initiative while I still had distance and the element of surprise. My finger moved from the trigger guard to the trigger itself. The creature took another step forward, and I could see every horrible detail of its face clearly now. This was it. This was the thing that had been taking people from these woods for generations, the nightmare that had driven Tom into early retirement and haunted my dreams for 15 years. It was real, it was right in front of me, and it was holding the head of its latest victim like a sick joke. The severed head tilted upward in the creature's grasp, and I watched in sick fascination as the dead woman's mouth opened. Her lips moved with unnatural precision, forming words that came out in that same mechanical tone we'd been hearing for the past hour. \"Help me. Please, help me.\" But this time, I could see exactly how it worked. The creature's own mouth remained completely closed. Its stretched lips sealed in that horrible grin, while the woman's head produced the sounds like some grotesque ventriloquist act. Her jaw moved up and down with clockwork timing. Her tongue shifting behind her teeth. But there was no breath behind the words, no life. Just the creature manipulating her vocal chords like pulling strings on a puppet. My stomach turned as I realized what I was witnessing. This thing had learned to operate a human throat from the inside. It understood the mechanics of speech well enough to make a dead woman's voice box function, but it had no concept of the emotions that should accompany those words. That's why the calls sounded so wrong, so empty. It was running a biological machine it didn't truly comprehend. The creature's black eye sockets fixed on us while it continued the demonstration. Holding the head at different angles, making the mouth open and closed in perfect rhythm. It was showing off. This wasn't just hunting anymore. It was playing with us, displaying its mastery over human anatomy like a cat batting around a mouse before the kill. Jasper's breathing had become shallow and rapid behind me. I could feel him shaking against my back, but he hadn't broken yet. That was something. I needed him functional for whatever came next. The creature began moving toward us again, and I raised my rifle to shoulder height. The weight felt solid and reassuring in my hands, even though I had no idea whether conventional ammunition would do anything meaningful to this thing. Tom had hit it 15 years ago, and it had disappeared. But disappeared didn't necessarily mean dead. For all I knew, we were facing the exact same creature that had taken those five researchers. Its gait was even more disturbing up close. Each step covered far too much ground, like it was sliding across the forest floor rather than walking on it. Its legs bent at angles that shouldn't have been possible, joints flexing in directions that made my eyes water to follow. The thing was tall enough that its head would have been level with the lower branches of the pine surrounding us, but it moved through the undergrowth without adjusting its path, as if the brush simply parted around it. I lined up the shot, centering the rifle's front sight on what I estimated was the creature's center of mass. Not much point in aiming for the head when it didn't seem to have eyes anyway, and I'd learned enough about anatomy during my years as a Ranger to know that center mass gave me the best chance of hitting something vital, assuming this thing had vital organs in the places they should be. My finger moved from the trigger guard to rest lightly on the trigger itself. The metal was cold against my skin and I forced myself to breathe steadily, the way I'd been trained. Inhale, exhale, find the natural pause between breaths where the shot would be steadiest. I'd done this before with bears, with aggressive elk, with rabid coyotes. But none of those had been carrying a human head and speaking through dead lips. The creature stopped approximately 30 feet away from us. Close enough that I could see every horrible detail of its face, but far enough that it could probably cover the distance in a single leap if it decided to charge. It stood there for a moment, perfectly still, holding the woman's head at shoulder height, like it was presenting evidence in some twisted courtroom. Then it tilted the head in our direction, angling it so the dead woman's face was looking directly at me. The lips moved again, but this time, the words came out different. Same voice, same mechanical precision, but the content had changed. \"Why won't you help me?\" The question hit me like a physical blow. It wasn't just mimicking the woman's voice anymore. It was engaging with us directly, using her vocal chords to communicate its own thoughts. The creature had learned enough about human speech patterns to construct new sentences, to hold a conversation through a severed head. \"Please, I'm hurt. Why won't you come help me?\" Jasper made a small whimpering sound behind me, but he managed to keep it quiet. I could feel his rifle barrel pressing against my shoulder blade as he tried to maintain his aim while staying close enough to use me as a psychological anchor. The kid was holding together better than I'd expected, better than I had during my first encounter with this thing.I kept my rifle trained on the creature's torso, but I didn't answer its questions. Engaging with it would be exactly what it wanted, some kind of response it could feed on, whether that was fear, or anger, or desperate hope. I'd seen what happened when people tried to reason with predators. It never ended well for the people. The creature seemed to sense my refusal to respond because it made a sound I hadn't heard before, a low throaty chuckle that came from its own mouth this time, not the woman's head. The sound was wet and wrong, like air being forced through damaged tissue. It knew exactly what it was doing to us. \"She was so scared when I found her,\" the creature said through the dead woman's lips, tilting the head at a different angle. \"She kept asking for help just like this over and over.\" My jaw clenched involuntarily. The thing was trying to get under my skin, trying to make me emotional. Angry people made mistakes. Angry people rushed in without thinking or hesitated when they should have acted. I'd seen it happen with other Rangers who let personal feelings cloud their judgment during dangerous encounters. But knowing what it was doing didn't make it any easier to listen to. \"She told me about her family,\" the creature continued. And now, the woman's head was facing Jasper. \"Her children, she wanted to see them again.\" Jasper's breathing hitched, and I felt his rifle waver slightly against my back. The kid was starting to crack. I needed to end this before he completely lost it. The creature took another step closer, and I could smell it now, that chemical stench mixed with decay that I remembered from 15 years ago. It was like nothing I'd ever encountered before or since, sharp and organic at the same time, making my sinuses burn and my eyes water. Whatever this thing was, it definitely wasn't from around here. \"You could help her now,\" it said, holding the head towards us like an offering. \"You could take her home to her family.\" That's when I realized what it was really doing. This wasn't just psychological torture. It was still hunting. The creature was trying to get us to come closer, to reach for the head, to break our defensive position. It wanted us to move toward it instead of making it come to us, probably because it knew that the moment one of us stepped forward, we'd be within range of whatever other capabilities it had that we hadn't seen yet. Those elongated arms could probably reach a lot farther than they looked. And if it could move through trees the way Tom had described, bending and flexing in impossible ways, then our current distance might not be as safe as I'd thought. I kept my aim steady and waited, let it make the next move, let it commit to an action that would give me a clear shot. The creature's head tilted to one side, studying us with those empty black sockets. It was learning from our behavior, figuring out what worked and what didn't. When the emotional manipulation hadn't drawn us forward, it would try something else. These things were patient when they needed to be, but they were also predators. Eventually, the hunting instinct would override the psychological games. Behind me, Jasper was getting himself back under control. His breathing had steadied, and the rifle barrel against my shoulder blade was solid again. Whatever internal battle he'd been fighting, he'd won it for now. The creature seemed to sense the change in him because it shifted its attention back to me. The woman's head turned in my direction again, and this time, when the lips moved, the voice was different, deeper, male. \"I remember you.\" My blood went cold. That wasn't the woman's voice anymore. It was Tom's voice, exactly as I remembered it from 15 years ago. Same gruff tone, same slight accent from his years in Texas before transferring to Pine Ridge. The creature had somehow learned Tom's voice, stored it away all this time, and was now using it against me. \"You were here before,\" it continued in Tom's voice. \"You and your partner, he shot me.\" I forced myself not to react, even though hearing Tom's voice coming from that severed head was making my skin crawl. The creature was confirming what I'd already suspected. This was the same entity from 15 years ago. It had survived Tom's shots, remembered us, and now it was back. \"Where is he now?\" the creature asked, tilting the woman's head like Tom used to do when he was thinking through a problem. \"Your partner, did he come back with you?\" It was fishing for information, trying to figure out if there were more Rangers in the area. That suggested it was still capable of caution, still aware that humans could pose a threat under the right circumstances. Tom's bullets had hurt it enough to make it retreat, even if they hadn't killed it. The creature took another step forward, closing the distance to maybe 25 feet, close enough that I could see the texture of its skin, mottled gray and black, like old leather that had been stretched too thin. There were places where it looked torn or damaged, revealing darker tissue underneath. Battle scars maybe, or just the natural decay that came with whatever this thing was. Its own mouth opened for the first time since we'd been watching it, revealing rows of teeth that were definitely not human. Too many of them, too sharp, arranged in patterns that made no evolutionary sense. When it spoke through its own vocal cords instead of the woman's head, the voice was like grinding stone. \"He ran away,\" it said, switching back to its own horrible voice. \"Left you here alone.\"That wasn't true. Tom had retired, moved to Florida, gotten as far away from these woods as possible, but he hadn't abandoned me in the field. We'd both made it out of that encounter 15 years ago, even if we'd both been changed by it. The creature was still trying to provoke an emotional response, still looking for that moment of weakness it could exploit. But now, it was getting impatient. I could see it in the way it held itself. The slight forward lean that suggested it was preparing to move. The psychological warfare phase was almost over. It began making a new sound then, a rapid clicking noise that came from somewhere deep in its throat. Not quite insect-like, but close enough to make my skin crawl. The sound echoed off the pine trees surrounding us, creating a chorus of clicks that seemed to come from everywhere at once. Jasper pressed closer against my back, and I could feel his fear spiking again. The clicking was getting louder, faster, building to some kind of crescendo that I didn't wanna stick around to hear the end of. The clicking was building to something I didn't want to find out about. My finger moved from the trigger guard to the trigger itself, feeling the familiar resistance of the metal. 25 feet away, the creature held that severed head like some kind of grotesque puppet. Its own mouth stretched in what might have been a grin if it belonged to anything remotely human. I'd been in this exact spot 15 years ago. Same clearing, same smell of decay mixed with something chemical and wrong. Tom had taken the shot then, three rounds into center mass, and the thing had just disappeared into the trees. But this time felt different. This time, I wasn't a rookie following someone else's lead. The clicking stopped. Complete silence dropped over the clearing like a heavy blanket. Even the insects had gone quiet again, leaving just the sound of Jasper's rapid breathing behind me and my own heartbeat in my ears. The creature tilted its head, studying us with those empty black sockets where eyes should've been. Its grip on the woman's head shifted, fingers repositioning with too many joints bending in directions that made my stomach turn. I squeezed the trigger. The rifle kicked against my shoulder. The crack of the gunshot splitting the silence and echoing off the pine trees around us. My shot caught the creature dead center in its chest, right where a human's heart would be. The impact sent it staggering backward, arms windmilling as it fought to keep its balance. The severed head tumbled from its grasp, hitting the ground with a wet sound that I tried not to think about too hard. Black fluid started pouring from the wound, not red like blood, but something dark and thick that looked wrong against the mottled, gray skin. The creature looked down at its chest, then back up at us, and that's when it made a sound I'll never forget. A shriek that started low in its throat and built to something that sounded like metal being torn apart, like nails on a chalkboard mixed with the screaming of brakes. The sound went right through me, making my teeth ache and my vision blur for a second. But the thing was still standing. I'd put a round center mass from 25 feet, close enough that I couldn't have missed if I tried, and it was still on its feet. The black fluid kept flowing from the wound, more than should've been possible, soaking into the strange skin and dripping onto the forest floor. But instead of collapsing, instead of showing any sign that the shot had done real damage, the creature straightened up and started moving toward us again. This time, there was nothing calculated about its approach. No more psychological games or voice mimicry or careful positioning. Pure fury radiated from every line of its body as it covered ground with those impossible strides. Joints bending wrong, arms reaching for us with fingers that were too long and had too many segments. \"Jasper!\" I shouted, not taking my eyes off the advancing creature. \"Shoot it in the head.\" Behind me, I heard Jasper's breathing hitch. Then the metallic sound of him working his rifle's action. The creature was 15 feet away now. Close enough that I could see the tears in its skin where the black fluid was seeping through. Close enough to make out individual teeth in that stretched mouth. Too many teeth arranged in rows that went deeper than any mouth should go. Jasper's rifle cracked behind me. His shot caught the creature right in its left eye socket. The hollow space that had been staring at us with nothing but darkness. The bullet punched through whatever passed for its skull and exploded out the back of its head in a spray of black fluid and fragments that I didn't want to identify. The thing stopped mid-stride. Its arms still reaching for us, but suddenly without any coordination behind the movement. For a second that felt like an hour, the creature just stood there, swaying slightly with its head tilted at an angle that would've broken a human neck. Then its legs folded beneath it. Those impossible joints collapsing in on themselves. And it hit the ground with a wet thud that I felt through the soles of my boots. The silence that followed was different from before. Not the oppressive quiet of something waiting to strike, but the genuine absence of threat. Even the insects started buzzing again. Tentative at first, then with more confidence as the seconds passed. I kept my rifle aimed at the creature's head, or what was left of it, and started moving forward. Slow steps, ready to put another round into the thing if it so much as twitched.... Jasper stayed close behind me. His breathing still uneven, but steadier than it had been. \"Is it dead?\" He whispered. \"We're about to find out.\" 10 feet away, I could see the damage Jasper's shot had done. The creature's skull had caved in on itself, leaving a crater where the back of its head used to be. Black fluid pooled beneath it, soaking into the pine needles and dark soil. But what caught my attention was the skin. The mottled gray color was changing, darkening to black and starting to peel away from whatever lay underneath. Five feet away, I stopped and watched. The skin wasn't just changing color, it was decomposing rapidly. Like time-lapse footage of decay, the gray flesh turned black, then started sloughing off in sheets that revealed white bone beneath. The smell hit us then, not just the chemical wrongness from before, but the sweet cloying stench of advanced rot. \"Jesus,\" Jasper breathed. \"What's happening to it?\" I didn't answer because I was too busy watching the creature dissolve. The process was accelerating, skin falling away in larger chunks, exposing a skeleton that looked almost human except for the proportions. Too tall, joints in the wrong places, extra segments in the fingers and vertebrae. The black fluid kept flowing more than the body should have been able to contain, spreading in a dark stain across the forest floor. Within minutes, nothing remained but bones and that spreading pool of black liquid. Even the bones looked wrong in the daylight, too white and too smooth, like they'd been carved rather than grown. The skull that Jasper had put a bullet through was cracked open like an eggshell, revealing nothing inside but empty space. I lowered my rifle and let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. Beside me, Jasper was staring at the remains with wide eyes, his rifle still raised and ready. \"It's over,\" I said more to convince myself than him. The black fluid was already soaking into the ground, disappearing into the soil like water into sand. By tomorrow, there probably wouldn't be any sign that the creature had ever existed except for those two white bones, and even those looked like they were starting to crumble at the edges. I looked around the clearing, taking in the suspended corpse in the tree branches, the dark stains on the ground where other victims had been brought, the severed head that lay a few feet away from the creature's remains. All of it would need to be dealt with, documented somehow, though I had no idea how to explain any of this in an official report. But right now, in this moment, the thing that had been taking people from these woods for generations was finally dead. The voice that had led search parties in circles was silent. The creature that had killed five researchers 15 years ago and drove Tom into early retirement had been stopped. Jasper finally lowered his rifle, his hand shaking as the adrenaline started to wear off. He looked at me with something between relief and horror, still processing what we'd just been through. The forest around us was quiet except for the normal sounds of insects and wind through the pine branches. No more clicking, no more false cries for help, no more footsteps that covered impossible distances. Just the peaceful silence of woods where nothing was hunting anymore. I pulled out my lighter before Jasper could get his cigarette to his mouth. His hands were shaking so badly he would've burned himself trying to get a flame going. The small metal lighter felt solid in my palm, familiar weight that grounded me after everything we'd just been through. \"Here,\" I said, flicking it open. The flame caught on the first try, steady and orange in the forest air. Jasper leaned forward, cigarette between his lips, and I could see his hands still trembling as he cupped them around the lighter. The paper caught, glowed red, and he took a long drag that made his shoulders drop slightly. \"Thanks,\" he said, exhaling smoke in a thin stream. I clicked the lighter shut and found myself a spot on the fallen log beside him. The bark was rough under my palms, probably a pine that had come down in last winter's storms. Jasper took another drag, deeper this time, and some of the color started coming back to his face. Still pale, but not the gray-white he'd been when we first walked into this clearing. The bones were still there, 20 feet away from us. What was left of the creature anyway, white and scattered now, some of them already starting to crumble at the edges where the black fluid had eaten away at them. In daylight filtering through the canopy, they looked almost normal. Almost like they could have belonged to a deer or elk that had died out here naturally. Almost, but I knew better. I'd seen what those bones had carried, the thing that had worn them like an ill-fitting suit. The impossibly long limbs, the joints that bent in directions that made my stomach turn just thinking about them. The empty eye sockets that had somehow still managed to watch us, track our movements, study us like we were specimens in a jar. Jasper finished his cigarette and immediately reached for another one. I didn't comment on it. Hell, I was considering asking him for one myself even though I'd quit smoking three years ago. Some situations called for old habits. \"We need to call it in,\" I said, pulling out my radio.\"What are you going to tell them?\" Good question. I'd been thinking about that ever since the creature's remains had finished dissolving into the ground. How do you explain something like this in a report? How do you write up an encounter with something that shouldn't exist, something that used a severed human head like a puppet to lure people to their deaths? \"That we found human remains,\" I said. That's technically true. The woman's body was still up there in the branches, impaled and hollowed out. That part would be easy enough to document. Suspicious death, possible homicide, call in the forensics team and let them figure out the details. They'd find evidence of the other victims too once they started looking. The dark stains in the soil, the bone fragments that were probably scattered throughout this clearing if you knew where to dig. What I wouldn't mention was the thing that had put them there. I keyed the radio and called back to dispatch, reported our location and requested a recovery team for human remains. The dispatcher's voice crackled back, professional and efficient, asking for details about the condition of the body and whether we needed immediate medical assistance. I gave her the basics, enough to get the right people moving in our direction, but kept it simple. \"ETA on the team?\" I asked. \"45 minutes to an hour,\" came the reply. \"Can you secure the scene until they arrive?\" \"Copy that. We'll maintain position.\" I clipped the radio back to my belt and looked at Jasper. He was halfway through his second cigarette, staring at the spot where the creature had fallen. His rifle was propped against the log beside him, still loaded, safety on. Good habits, even when his world had just been turned upside down. \"An hour,\" I told him. He nodded, but didn't say anything, just kept smoking and staring. I could practically see his mind working, trying to process what we'd been through, trying to fit it into some kind of framework that made sense. I knew that feeling. I'd been exactly where he was 15 years ago, sitting in this same clearing with Tom, waiting for backup and wondering if I was losing my mind. Wondering if what I'd seen was real or if the stress of the job had finally gotten to me. The difference was that Tom had been just as shaken as I was. We'd both seen it, both shot at it, both watched it disappear into the woods trailing black fluid instead of blood. We'd had each other to confirm that, yes, this had really happened. Yes, we'd both seen the same impossible thing. Jasper only had me, and I was the one who'd known what we were walking into, who'd led him here with full knowledge of what we might find. That had to be weighing on him. \"You did good back there,\" I said. He looked at me, cigarette dangling from his lips. \"Did I?\" \"That head shot saved both our lives. I hit it center mass and it kept coming. Your shot is what dropped it.\" \"I was terrified.\" \"Good. Being scared means you understood the situation correctly.\" He almost smiled at that, almost. \"Is that what you told yourself 15 years ago?\" \"Tom told me that. After we got back to the station and filed our reports, he said fear was just information, and the information it was giving us was that we were dealing with something dangerous.\" \"Smart guy.\" \"Yeah, he was.\" We sat in silence for a while. The forest around us had returned to normal, insects buzzing in the undergrowth, wind moving through the pine branches overhead. No more clicking sounds. No more impossible footsteps covering too much ground too quickly. Just the ordinary sounds of woods where nothing was hunting. But I kept my rifle close anyway. Old habits. Jasper stubbed out his second cigarette on the log and looked up at the tree branches where the woman's body was suspended. \"How long do you think she was alive when it took her?\" \"Don't think about that.\" Hard not to. I understood. The creature had known details about her family, her children. It had used that information to try to manipulate us, to draw us closer, which meant it had talked to her before she died, had learned those details somehow, whether through conversation or something worse. I didn't want to speculate. \"The important thing is that it's dead now,\" I said. \"It won't take anyone else.\" \"How do you know there aren't more of them?\" That was the question I'd been dreading, the one I'd been asking myself for 15 years, ever since Tom and I had walked out of these woods and tried to convince ourselves that what we'd encountered was some kind of isolated incident. \"I don't know,\" I said. \"But I've been watching this section of forest for five years now, and this is the first sign of activity I've seen. If there were more of them in the immediate area, I think we'd have noticed.\" \"What about other areas? Other forests?\" \"That's not our jurisdiction.\" It was a copout answer, and we both knew it, but it was also the truth. We were responsible for this section of Pine Ridge, these specific trails and clearings and camp sites. What happened in other national forests, other states, other countries, that was someone else's problem, even if I suspected it was a much bigger problem than anyone wanted to admit. The radio crackled and dispatch updated us on the recovery team's ETA. 20 minutes out now. I could hear vehicles in the distance, still faint but getting closer. The cavalry was coming, complete with cameras and evidence bags and forms to fill out in triplicate. \"What happens now?\" Jasper asked.\"Now, we do our jobs. We secure the scene, we cooperate with the investigation, we file our reports. We go back to regular patrols and hope nothing like this happens again.\" \"And if it does?\" I looked at him, this kid who'd been a ranger for less than six months and had already seen more than most people see in a lifetime. He was handling it better than I'd expected, better than I had probably when I was his age. \"If it does, we deal with it. Same as we dealt with this one.\" \"Together?\" \"Together.\" He nodded and reached for another cigarette. Then thought better of it and put the pack away. Good choice. The recovery team would be here soon, and showing up to a crime scene chain-smoking probably wouldn't make the best impression. I stood up and walked over to the creature's remains, what little was left of them. The bones were more fragmented now. Some of them nothing but white powder scattered across the forest floor. In another hour or two, there might not be any trace left at all, which was probably for the best. Try explaining those proportions to a forensics team. Try explaining joints that bent in impossible directions, or a skull with eye sockets too large and too deep for any known species. Better to let the forest reclaim them. Let them become part of the soil, part of the endless cycle of growth and decay that kept these woods alive. I heard engines getting closer, the sound of heavy vehicles navigating the dirt roads that led back to this section of forest. The recovery team would be here in a few minutes, along with investigators and medical examiners, and probably half a dozen other specialists I couldn't even name. They'd photograph everything, measure everything, catalog every detail they could find. They'd take the woman's body down from the tree branches and transport it back to the city for autopsy. They'd collect soil samples from the dark stains in the clearing and run tests that would probably come back inconclusive. And eventually, they'd file their reports and close the case and move on to the next mystery, because that's how the system worked. You documented what you could document, you followed the evidence where it led, and you didn't ask too many questions about the things that didn't fit into neat categories. Jasper joined me beside the scattered bones, careful not to step on any of the fragments. \"Think they'll find anything useful?\" \"They'll find enough to confirm that someone killed her. That's probably all they need.\" \"And the rest of it?\" \"The rest of it stays between us.\" He looked at me, understanding passing between us. This was bigger than official reports and evidence logs. This was the kind of knowledge that changed you, that made you see the world differently. The kind of knowledge that came with responsibility. The engine sounds were getting louder now. I could make out individual vehicles, probably three or four of them winding their way along the old logging trails toward our position. In a few minutes, this quiet clearing would be full of people with clipboards and cameras, all of them focused on documenting a crime scene that told only half the story. I shouldered my rifle and started walking back toward the main trail. Jasper fell into step beside me, his own weapon secured, his color almost back to normal. We'd wait at the trailhead for the recovery team, guide them back to the clearing, and then spend the rest of the day answering questions and filling out paperwork. But the real work was done. The thing that had been taking people from these woods for generations was dead, dissolved into nothing but bone fragments and dark stains in the soil. The forest was safe again, at least this part of it. And maybe that was enough. Maybe that was all we could ask for. The first vehicle came into view through the trees, a white van with county markings and emergency lights flashing. Behind it, two more vehicles, probably the investigative team and the medical examiner's office. I keyed my radio and confirmed our position, guided them to the parking area where Jasper and I had left our trucks. Professional voices responded, efficient and businesslike, treating this as just another day at the office, which in a way it was. People died in national forests all the time, some from accidents, some from exposure, some from violence. The system was designed to handle these situations, to process them according to established protocols. What the system wasn't designed to handle was the truth about what had really happened here, but that was fine. Some truths were too big for paperwork anyway. Jasper and I reached the trailhead just as the first van pulled up. Doors opened and people climbed out, already reaching for equipment and clipboards. The machine was in motion now, all the gears and procedures that would turn this morning's events into official documentation. I watched them organize themselves, listened to them coordinate their approach to the scene. Professional, competent, focused on their jobs, they'd do good work, thorough work. They'd find what they needed to find, but they wouldn't find the whole story. That was something only Jasper and I would carry, along with the knowledge that sometimes the monsters in the woods were real, and sometimes ordinary people had to step up and face them. The team leader approached us, a woman in her 40s with graying hair and sharp eyes. She introduced herself as Detective Morrison, no relation to Frank, just one of those coincidences, and started asking the standard questions about how we discovered the scene. I answered carefully, sticking to the facts that mattered for her investigation. We'd been responding to reports of someone calling for help. We'd tracked the voice to this location. We'd found the body and called it in. All true, just not the whole truth. As we talked, I noticed Jasper listening carefully, learning how to navigate the space between what had happened and what could be officially documented. It was a skill every ranger needed, especially in country like this where the official explanations didn't always cover everything you might encounter. The detective finished her initial questions and started organizing her team for the walk back to the clearing. I volunteered to guide them to make sure they didn't miss any important details. Jasper stayed behind to coordinate with the medical examiner's team. As we walked back along the deer trail, I found myself thinking about Tom, wondering what he'd think about all this. He'd probably be relieved that the thing was finally dead, that it wouldn't be taking any more victims. But he'd also be worried about what else might be out there, what other threats we hadn't encountered yet. Fair enough. I was worried about that too. But for now, this was enough, one threat eliminated, one section of forest made safe again. We'd done our job, protected the people who came here to hike and camp, and enjoy the wilderness. And if other threats emerged, well, we'd deal with those when the time came. That's what we were here for."
