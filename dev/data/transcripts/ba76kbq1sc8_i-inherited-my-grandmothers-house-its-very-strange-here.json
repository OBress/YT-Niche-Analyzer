  "full_text": "I pulled my car into the gravel driveway and sat there for a moment, looking up at the house that now belonged to me. Three weeks had passed since Rita's funeral, and I'd finally worked up the nerve to come back. The Victorian stood exactly as I remembered it from childhood visits, tall and narrow with peeling white paint and dark green shutters that needed replacing. The wraparound porch sagged slightly on the left side, and the ornate gingerbread trim looked more weathered than it had even five years ago. Rita had always been meticulous about maintaining her home, but the last few years had clearly taken their toll on both her and the property. I grabbed my duffle bag from the passenger seat and walked up the familiar wooden steps. They creaked under my weight, the same protest they'd made when I was eight years old and running up them to hug my grandmother. The brass key felt heavy in my palm as I slid it into the lock and turned. The front door swung open with a groan, and the smell hit me immediately. Lavender and old wood, Rita's signature combination. She'd kept dried lavender sachets in every room and polished the antique furniture with lemon oil every Sunday after church. The scent was so distinctly hers that, for a split second, I expected to hear her voice calling from the kitchen asking if I wanted tea and cookies. Instead, silence greeted me. Not the comfortable quiet of a lived-in home, but the hollow emptiness of a place where life had simply stopped. I stepped inside and set my bag down on the hardwood floor. The entryway looked smaller than I remembered, but everything else remained exactly as Rita had left it. The grandfather clock in the corner had stopped at 4:27, probably the moment the power had been cut after her death. Family photos lined the mantelpiece above the fireplace, including several of me at various ages, always grinning next to Rita's gentle smile. My eyes moved automatically to the front door, where the wooden cross hung just as it always had. Rita had carved it herself decades ago, back when her arthritis hadn't yet claimed the steadiness in her hands. The wood was dark with age, and the simple design showed the wear of countless fingers touching it over the years. The ritual came back to me as clearly as if Rita were standing beside me, her soft voice explaining what needed to be done. Every night before bed, without fail, lock the door then reach up and flip the cross, so it hung upside down. \"To keep them in,\" she'd always said when I asked why. Never, \"To keep them out,\" like you'd expect from someone worried about burglars or wild animals. Always \"In.\" I'd been maybe six the first time she taught me the routine. Mom had brought me for a week-long visit during summer break, and Rita had insisted I learn the proper way to secure the house for the night. Even then, the explanation had struck me as odd. Who were they, and why did we want to keep them inside rather than outside? \"It's just something we do in this house, dear,\" Rita would say whenever I pressed for details. \"Something very important.\" Mom had the same non-answer ready whenever I brought it up at home. \"Your grandmother has her ways, Dakota. Just humor her.\" But it hadn't felt like humoring an old woman's quirks. The way Rita watched me perform the ritual, the relief that would cross her face when I got it right, there was real weight behind it, real fear of what might happen if I forgot or did it wrong. The memory that always made my skin crawl was from when I was eight. I'd been staying with Rita for two weeks that summer while Mom dealt with some work crisis. The guest bedroom upstairs had become my temporary home, and I'd grown comfortable with the routine of the house. Rita would tuck me in around 9:00. I'd read comic books by lamplight until I got sleepy, then drift off to the sound of the old house settling around me. One night, I'd gotten up to use the bathroom and caught sight of something in the guest bedroom window as I walked past. At first, I thought it was my own reflection, a boy about my age with dark hair and pale skin. But when I moved, the reflection didn't move with me. It just stood there, perfectly still, watching me from the other side of the glass. I'd frozen in the hallway. My bare feet suddenly cold against the wooden floor. The boy in the window had the same general build as me, but his clothes looked old-fashioned, like something from a movie about the 1950s. His face was serious, almost sad, and his eyes seemed to be looking directly at me rather than through me. When I blinked, he was gone. I'd convinced myself it was just a trick of the light, maybe headlights from a car passing on the road outside. But the next night, I saw him again. Same window, same clothes, same expression. This time, I'd worked up the courage to wave. The boy had lifted his hand in response, a slow, deliberate gesture that made my stomach flip. That's when I knew it wasn't a reflection. The third night, I'd been lying in bed reading when I heard footsteps in the hallway. Soft, careful steps that didn't match Rita's shuffling gait or Mom's quick pace. I'd crept to my bedroom door and peered out through the crack. A boy stood at the far end of the hall near the window where I'd seen the reflection. He was real, not a trick of glass or light, but an actual person standing in my grandmother's house at 10 o'clock at night. He wore short pants and a button-up shirt that looked like they belonged in a museum, and his hair was combed neatly to one side in a style no kid my age would ever choose.\"Hello,\" he'd said when he noticed me watching. His voice sounded strange, like it was coming from very far away even though he was only 15 feet down the hall. \"Hi,\" I'd whispered back, my heart hammering against my ribs. \"I'm Hayden,\" the boy had said. \"I live here too.\" I'd wanted to tell him that was impossible, that only Rita lived in this house, and she definitely would have mentioned having another kid around. But something about his serious expression and the careful way he spoke made me hold back the obvious questions. \"I'm Dakota,\" I'd managed instead. Hayden had nodded like he already knew that. \"You're visiting your grandmother?\" \"Yeah, for two weeks.\" \"She's very kind,\" Hayden had said. \"She takes good care of this house, good care of us.\" Before I could ask what he meant by us, footsteps on the stairs had made us both turn. Rita's voice had drifted up from the first floor, calling my name with concern. \"Dakota, are you awake, dear?\" When I looked back down the hallway, Hayden was gone, just vanished, like he'd never been there at all. Rita had found me standing in my doorway, probably looking confused and scared. She'd taken one look at my face and her expression had shifted to something I couldn't quite read. Not surprise exactly, but recognition. \"Bad dream?\" she'd asked gently, guiding me back into the guest room. \"I saw a boy,\" I told her, \"in the hallway. He said his name was Hayden.\" Rita had gone very still for a moment. Her hand pausing in the middle of pulling my blanket up to my chin. Then she'd smiled, but it hadn't reached her eyes. \"Just your imagination, sweetheart. Old houses make strange sounds at night. Sometimes our minds play tricks on us.\" But I'd known it wasn't my imagination. Hayden had been as real as Rita standing beside my bed. He'd spoken to me, told me his name, said he lived in the house too. You don't imagine conversations that detailed and specific. The next morning at breakfast, I'd mentioned Hayden to mom. She'd exchanged a quick look with Rita, the kind of look adults share when they think kids aren't paying attention. \"There's no boy named Hayden here, honey,\" mom had said in her patient voice. \"You probably had a very vivid dream. This old house can seem spooky when you're not used to it.\" I'd tried to argue, to explain that I'd been wide awake and had talked to him, but they both insisted it was just my imagination running wild. After a while, I'd stopped bringing it up, but I'd never stopped believing it had really happened. Now, standing in Rita's entryway 20 years later, I found myself looking toward the staircase that led to the guest bedroom. The house felt different without her presence filling it. Quieter, but also somehow more alert, like it was holding its breath waiting for something. I picked up my bag and headed toward the kitchen to see what kind of food Rita had left behind. The refrigerator was empty. Mom had cleaned it out after the funeral. But the pantry still held canned goods and boxes of tea that would probably last me the few weeks I planned to stay. I wasn't sure yet what I'd do with the house long-term. Rita had left it to me in her will along with a letter explaining that she trusted me to do what's right when the time comes. Typical Rita, cryptic and vague when you needed specifics. Mom had suggested I sell it, use the money to pay off my student loans and maybe put a down payment on a place closer to my job in the city, the practical choice. But something about the idea of selling felt wrong. This house had been in our family for three generations. Rita's parents had bought it in the 1920s, and she'd lived here her entire life except for the few years she'd spent married to my grandfather. It held too much history to just hand over to strangers. I spent the afternoon unpacking my clothes and getting reacquainted with the layout. Everything was exactly as I remembered. The narrow staircase with its worn banister, the kitchen with its ancient appliances and cheerful yellow wallpaper, the living room with its overstuffed furniture and shelves full of books Rita had read multiple times. By evening, I'd settled into the familiar rhythm of the house. I made myself a simple dinner of canned soup and crackers, then sat in Rita's favorite armchair to read one of her mystery novels. The grandfather clock stayed silent in the corner, its hands frozen at 4:27, but I could track the passage of time by the way the light faded outside the windows. When full darkness fell, muscle memory kicked in. I found myself standing up from the chair and walking toward the front door without really thinking about it. The wooden cross hung right where it always had and the deadbolt turned easily under my fingers. Click. Lock the door, reach up, grasp the cross, flip it upside down. To keep them in, I completed the ritual exactly as Rita had taught me, my hands moving through the motions automatically. It felt strange to be doing it without her watching, without her satisfied nod when I got it right. But it also felt necessary, like skipping it would be inviting some kind of trouble I wasn't prepared to handle. As I headed upstairs to the guest bedroom, I couldn't shake the feeling that the house was different now. Not just empty, but expectant, like it had been waiting patiently for Rita to leave so it could finally show me something she'd been keeping hidden. I paused at the top of the stairs and looked down the hallway toward the window where I'd seen Hayden's reflection all those years ago. The glass was dark now, reflecting only the dim light from the overhead fixture.... but I found myself half-expecting to see that serious young face looking back at me, waiting to have another conversation that everyone would insist was just my imagination. The guest bedroom felt smaller than I remembered, but the same quilt covered the bed and the same lace curtains hung at the windows. I changed into pajamas and settled under the covers with another of Rita's books, listening to the familiar sounds of the old house settling around me. Somewhere around midnight, I finally turned off the lamp and closed my eyes. The house grew quiet except for the occasional creak of old wood adjusting to the night's cooler temperature. But even as I drifted toward sleep, I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't alone. The house felt like it was watching me, waiting to see what I would do now that Rita was gone and I was the only one left to maintain whatever strange tradition she'd passed down to me. Whatever they were that needed to be kept in, I had the unsettling suspicion that they were still here, still waiting behind whatever barrier the upside-down cross was meant to maintain. I woke to the sound of paper sliding across hardwood. The noise came from downstairs, faint but distinct enough to pull me from sleep. I lay still for a moment, listening to the house settle around me. Rita's old Victorian had its own language of creaks and sighs, but this had been different. Deliberate. I pushed back the quilt and padded barefoot to the guest bedroom doorway. The hallway stretched empty in both directions. Morning light filtering through the lace curtains at the far end. Everything looked normal, but something had definitely woken me up. Downstairs, I found a white envelope on the entryway floor positioned precisely where someone had slipped it under the front door. I picked it up and examined the front. My address was written in careful cursive, but the name above it made me pause. Hayden Wong. I turned the envelope over. The return address showed a street name I didn't recognize, somewhere across town, with the name M. Burns printed in the same neat handwriting. No postmark. Someone had delivered this by hand. I tore open the envelope and unfolded a single sheet of paper. \"Dear Hayden,\" it began. \"I hope this letter finds you well. It has been far too long since we last spoke, and I wanted to reach out to see how you and your family are settling into your new home. Please write back soon. Your loving sister, Mariah.\" I read it twice, then checked the envelope again. Definitely my address. Definitely not my name. The phone book sat in Rita's kitchen drawer where it had always been. I flipped through the pages until I found the street listed in the return address, then dialed the number. \"Hello?\" The voice belonged to an elderly woman, slightly breathless, as if she'd hurried to answer. \"Hi. This is Dakota Payne. I received a letter addressed to someone named Hayden Wong at my house, and I wanted to return it to you.\" Silence stretched across the line. Then, \"You found him? Oh, thank goodness. I've been trying to reach Hayden for months.\" \"No. I think there's been a mistake. I live alone, and I don't know anyone named Hayden Wong.\" \"But the address,\" she said, and I could hear papers rustling. \"123 Maple Street. That's where Hayden moved with his family.\" \"That is my address, but you must be mistaken, dear. Hayden wrote to me when he first moved there. That was back in 1952. He was so excited about the house, said it was perfect for Chelsea and the boys.\" My grip tightened on the phone. \"Ma'am, I think you might be confused. My grandmother owned this house for decades. There's no Hayden Wong here.\" \"Chelsea is his wife,\" Mariah continued as if I hadn't spoken. \"Such a sweet girl. And the boys, Jasper and Tommy, they'd be in their teens by now. How are they doing?\" \"Ma'am, please listen to me. There's no family here. Just me. And it's 2023, not 1952.\" Another pause. When she spoke again, her voice carried a note of stubborn certainty. \"Hayden moved to 123 Maple Street in 1952 with his wife, Chelsea, and his two sons. I have his letter right here. Are you sure you're not just a neighbor who picked up his mail by mistake?\" The conversation felt like trying to navigate through fog. Every time I explained the situation, she circled back to the same information as if it were absolute fact. \"I need to go,\" I said finally. \"Wait. Please, if you see Hayden, tell him Mariah called. Tell him I miss him.\" I hung up before she could say anything else. The letter lay on the kitchen counter where I'd left it, the careful handwriting suddenly looking less innocent. I folded it back into the envelope and shoved both into the drawer next to the phone book. Whatever strange mix-up this was, I didn't want to deal with it right now. Rita had kept her important papers in a wooden filing cabinet in the living room. I'd avoided going through it since moving in, but now I pulled out the folders and spread them across the coffee table. Mortgage documents, property tax records, insurance papers. I read through each one carefully, looking for any mention of previous owners. According to every document I could find, Rita had purchased the house in 1948 from a family named Miller. No mention of anyone named Wong. No record of the house changing hands in 1952.I spent the rest of the day trying to push the phone call out of my mind. I organized Rita's books, cleaned the kitchen thoroughly, and even tackled the overgrown flower beds outside. But Mariah's voice kept echoing in my head, so certain about details that made no sense. When evening came, I went through my usual routine. I heated a can of soup, ate it while reading one of Rita's mystery novels, and waited for full darkness before approaching the front door. The wooden cross hung right-side up, just as it had every morning since I'd moved in. I turned the deadbolt, grasped the cross, and flipped it upside down. The ritual felt more important tonight, though I couldn't say why. I was halfway up the stairs when I heard them. Footsteps, not the random creaks and settling sounds the old house made, but deliberate steps moving across the floor above me. Slow, measured, like someone walking carefully to avoid making noise. I stopped on the landing, one hand gripping the banister. The footsteps continued, moving from what sounded like the guest bedroom toward the hallway. I counted them, one, two, three, four, then silence. My heart hammered against my ribs. I should go back downstairs, maybe call someone. But instead, I found myself climbing the remaining steps. Each one seemed to echo louder than it should. The hallway stretched before me, dimly lit by the small window at the far end. At first, everything looked normal. Then I saw the figure standing near the guest bedroom doorway, a boy, maybe eight years old, wearing clothes that looked like they belonged in an old photograph. Short pants, a button-up shirt, hair combed neatly to one side. He stood perfectly still, watching me with dark eyes that seemed too old for his face. I froze on the top step, unable to move forward or back. The boy hadn't moved, not even to blink. His dark eyes stayed fixed on me as I gripped the banister, my knuckles probably white by now. 20 years had passed since I'd seen that face, but he looked exactly the same. Eight years old, maybe a little small for his age, with that neat haircut and those clothes that belonged in an old family photograph. \"Hayden,\" I said, the name coming out barely above a whisper. He nodded slowly. \"You remember me?\" His voice had that same hollow quality I remembered from childhood, like it was coming from somewhere far away. The translucent quality of his skin became more obvious now that I was really looking at him. I could see the faint outline of the hallway wall through his shoulder. \"I need to explain,\" he said, taking a small step toward me, \"About the house. About why your grandmother made you turn the cross upside down every night.\" I wanted to back down the stairs, to run, to do anything except stand there listening to a dead boy talk about Rita's ritual, but my legs wouldn't cooperate. \"She told you it was to keep us in,\" Hayden continued. \"That was true, but there's more you need to know.\" He turned and walked toward the stairs, moving past me with that same careful, measured pace I remembered. When he reached the top step, he looked back. \"Come with me, please.\" Against every instinct screaming in my head, I followed him down to the living room. The grandfather clock still showed 4:27, its hands frozen in the same position they'd been in for who knows how long. Hayden stopped near Rita's armchair and turned to face the center of the room. \"Jasper,\" he called softly. \"Mom, he's ready to know.\" The air in front of the coffee table began to shimmer, like heat waves rising from summer pavement. Two shapes took form gradually, becoming more solid with each passing second. A smaller boy appeared first, maybe six years old, with tousled light brown hair and the same translucent skin as Hayden. He wore short pants and a button-up shirt, both looking like they'd been pressed and cleaned decades ago. Next to him, a woman materialized. She was tall and slender, wearing a faded floral dress that fell to her calves. Her dark hair was styled in waves that framed her face, and her sunken eyes held a sadness that seemed to go deeper than anything I'd ever seen. Like Hayden and the younger boy, I could see through her to the bookshelf behind. \"This is my brother, Jasper,\" Hayden said, gesturing to the smaller boy. \"And our mother, Chelsea.\" Chelsea stepped forward slightly, her movement creating no sound on the hardwood floor. \"Hello, Dakota. We've been waiting a long time to speak with you properly.\" My mouth felt dry. \"You're all-\" \"Dead,\" Hayden finished. \"We died in this house in 1953.\" Jasper spoke for the first time, his voice even softer than his brother's. \"Our father killed us.\" The words hit me like a physical blow. I sank into Rita's armchair without thinking, my legs finally giving out. \"Your father?\" Chelsea's expression grew even more pained. \"Marvin Wong, my husband. He came back from the war changed, angry. He couldn't sleep, couldn't work. The smallest things would set him off into rages.\" \"He got worse and worse,\" Hayden added. \"Mom tried to protect us, tried to keep him calm.\"\"But one night...\" \"One night, he snapped,\" Chelsea continued when Hayden trailed off. \"He killed the boys first, then me, then himself.\" I stared at them, these three translucent figures standing in Rita's living room like they belonged there. \"But the letter, Mariah Burns, she said you moved here in 1952.\" \"We did,\" Chelsea said. \"Mariah is Marvin's sister. She helped us find this place when we needed somewhere to start over. She doesn't know what happened to us. As far as she knows, we just disappeared.\" \"We've been trapped here ever since,\" Hayden said. \"Unable to leave, unable to move on.\" I looked at Chelsea, trying to process everything they were telling me. \"And Rita knew about you?\" Chelsea nodded. \"Your grandmother could see us from the day she bought the house. We were different then, angrier. The violence of our deaths, the shock of being trapped here, it made us dangerous.\" \"We didn't mean to be,\" Jasper said quietly. \"But we were scared and confused.\" \"Rita found ways to contain us,\" Chelsea continued. \"The cross, the locked door. It created a barrier that kept our spirits from affecting the physical world too much, from hurting anyone.\" \"She was protecting people from us,\" Hayden said. \"And in a way, protecting us from ourselves.\" I sat there in Rita's armchair, trying to process everything they told me. The three spirits stood before me, translucent and still, waiting for my response to their revelation about Rita's protective measures. \"Rita was doing what she thought was best,\" Chelsea continued, her voice carrying that same whisper-like quality. \"She was protecting you by not telling you about us. And she was protecting others from what we had become.\" \"We were so angry for so long,\" Jasper added. His small voice echoing strangely in the room. \"The way we died being trapped here, it made us dangerous.\" I found my voice, though it came out rougher than I expected. \"But you're not dangerous now.\" Hayden took a step closer to my chair, his translucent form moving with that same measured pace I remembered from 20 years ago. \"No, we're not angry anymore. We've had decades to understand what happened to us, to accept it. We just want to be free now. We want to move on.\" The grandfather clock continued its eternal silence at 4:27. I looked between the three of them, these spirits who had been trapped in my family's house since before I was born. \"The woman who called,\" I said, \"Mariah Burns, she really is your aunt?\" \"Yes,\" Hayden confirmed. \"She's my father's sister. She helped us move here in 1952, thought it would be a fresh start for our family. She doesn't know what happened to us. She's been looking for us all these years, not knowing we died here.\" Chelsea's form flickered slightly, like a candle flame in a breeze. When she stabilized, her sunken eyes fixed on mine with an intensity that made me grip the armrests of the chair. \"There's only one way to free us,\" she said. \"You have to unlock the door. Turn the cross right side up and burn the house down. The fire will release our spirits.\" The words hit me like a physical blow. \"Burn the house down?\" \"It's the only way,\" Chelsea repeated. \"The barriers Rita created, they're woven into the very structure of this place. The wood, the walls, even the foundation holds part of what keeps us here. Fire will break those bonds completely.\" I stared at her, then at Hayden and Jasper. \"If I do this, will it truly free you? Will you find peace?\" Hayden nodded, his dark eyes meeting mine. \"Yes, it will finally allow us to leave, to go wherever we're supposed to go next.\" \"We've been waiting so long,\" Jasper whispered. I leaned back in the armchair, my mind racing. They wanted me to destroy the house Rita had left me, the house that held so much family history, but it also held these three souls who had been prisoners here for 70 years. \"Tell me everything,\" I said finally. \"I want to understand exactly what happened to you, all of it.\" For the next hour, I listened as they shared their story. Chelsea spoke about the early days of their marriage, how Marvin had been different before the war. Hayden described their life before moving to this house, the hope they'd all felt about starting fresh. Jasper, despite being the youngest, remembered details about their father's gradual change, the way his anger had grown like a poison. They told me about their final day, how Marvin had seemed calmer that morning, almost normal. Chelsea had thought maybe he was getting better. Then evening came, and something had snapped in him. The boys had been playing in the living room when he'd called them upstairs. Chelsea had followed, worried by the strange tone in his voice. \"He used a knife,\" Chelsea said simply, her form flickering again. \"He was quick with the boys, I think. I think part of him still loved them enough to make it fast.\"\"With me, he took longer,\" she continued, her voice becoming even quieter. \"He was crying the whole time, saying he was sorry, that he couldn't let us leave him. Then he used the same knife on himself.\" Hayden picked up the story from there, describing their confusion when they'd awakened as spirits, still in the house but unable to touch anything solid, unable to leave. How Rita had arrived a few years later and immediately seen them, how frightened she'd been at first. \"She tried to help us move on,\" Jasper explained. \"She brought in a priest, tried different rituals. Nothing worked. We were stuck here, and we were so angry about it. We started breaking things, making noises, trying to scare people away.\" \"Rita realized we were dangerous,\" Hayden said. \"Not because we wanted to hurt anyone, but because our anger was so strong it affected the physical world around us. Things would fly off shelves when we got upset. Doors would slam. The temperature would drop so fast that pipes would freeze.\" Chelsea nodded. \"She spent months figuring out how to contain us. The cross ritual, keeping the door locked at night, even rearranging furniture in specific ways. It created barriers that dampened our ability to affect things around us.\" \"She was protecting everyone,\" I said slowly. \"Including us,\" Hayden confirmed. \"She knew that if we kept lashing out, if we hurt someone, it would make everything worse for us. She was giving us time to work through our anger, to find peace with what had happened.\" I sat in Rita's chair, surrounded by these three gentle spirits, and finally understood the weight my grandmother had carried all those years. She'd known about them, had been protecting both them and everyone else, including me. I needed to know more. The weight of their story pressed down on me, but gaps remained that I couldn't ignore. \"You mentioned Marvin came back from the war changed,\" I said, looking at Chelsea. \"What was he like before?\" Chelsea's translucent form shifted slightly, her hands clasping together in front of her faded floral dress. \"He was gentle once. Quiet, but in a thoughtful way. He'd bring me flowers from the neighbors' garden and spend hours teaching Hayden how to whittle little animals from scraps of wood.\" Hayden nodded, his small face carrying an expression far too mature for an eight-year-old. \"He showed me how to carve a horse. I still remember his hands guiding mine on the knife.\" \"The Korean War broke something inside him,\" Chelsea continued, her voice growing softer. \"When he returned, he couldn't sleep through the night. He'd wake up screaming, sometimes swinging at shadows. During the day, he'd sit for hours staring at nothing, then explode into rage over the smallest things.\" I watched her face as she spoke, seeing the pain etched into her ghostly features. \"Is that when you tried to leave?\" \"The first time was three months after he came home.\" Chelsea's form flickered slightly, like a candle flame in a breeze. \"I packed what I could carry and took the boys to my sister's house across town. Marvin found us within two days. He apologized, promised he'd get better, said he just needed time to adjust.\" Jasper spoke up, his small voice barely above a whisper. \"He cried when he brought us back, said he was sorry for scaring us.\" \"I believed him,\" Chelsea said, and I heard the regret in her tone. \"I wanted to believe him, but it happened again-\" \"I believed him,\" Chelsea said, and I heard the regret in her tone. \"I wanted to believe him, but it happened again and again. Each time I tried to leave, he'd track us down. He had friends from the war, men who understood how to find people who didn't want to be found.\" \"How many times?\" I asked. \"Four,\" Hayden answered. \"The last time we made it all the way to Aunt Mariah's house. We stayed there for almost a week.\" Chelsea nodded, her expression growing darker. \"Mariah begged me to stay permanently. She could see what Marvin was becoming, but I was terrified of what he might do if I refused to come back. He'd started making threats, saying he'd rather see us dead than living without him.\" The room felt colder as she spoke, and I noticed frost beginning to form on the edges of the coffee table. \"The night it happened,\" Chelsea continued, \"I had everything ready again. Our clothes were hidden in a suitcase under the bed. I'd saved enough money for bus tickets to Mariah's house. I was planning to take the boys and leave while Marvin was at work the next day.\" \"But he found out?\" I asked. \"He came home early,\" Jasper said quietly. \"We were playing in the living room, and Mom was upstairs packing the last of our things.\" Chelsea's form wavered, becoming more transparent. \"He must've seen the suitcase. When he called the boys upstairs, his voice was different. Calm, but wrong somehow. I knew immediately that he'd discovered our plan.\" The grandfather clock's silence felt heavier now, marking time that had stopped for them 70 years ago. \"I don't want you to think we blame you,\" Chelsea said, turning her attention back to me, \"for staying here all these years, for continuing Rita's ritual. We understand why she did what she did.\"\"Rita was kind to us,\" Hayden added. \"Even when we were angry and breaking things, she never yelled at us or tried to hurt us. She'd sit in that chair where you're sitting now and talk to us about you.\" \"About me?\" \"She told us about your visits as a child, how you'd ask questions about everything, how you'd help her in the garden.\" Chelsea's voice carried a warmth I hadn't heard before. \"She was so proud of you. She said you had a good heart, that you'd understand someday why she did what she did.\" I felt a lump forming in my throat. \"She never told me about you directly.\" \"She was protecting you,\" Jasper said simply. \"The same way she protected everyone else.\" As we talked, I began to notice something changing. The edges of their forms were becoming less distinct and the room seemed to be growing lighter. I glanced toward the windows and realized the first hints of dawn were creeping through the curtains. \"You're fading,\" I said. Hayden looked down at his hands which were now barely visible. \"We can't maintain this form once the sun comes up. The daylight makes it harder for us to appear.\" \"Will I see you again?\" \"Tomorrow night,\" Hayden said, his voice already growing distant. \"If you're willing to help us.\" Chelsea stepped forward. Her form now so translucent, I could clearly see the bookshelf behind her. \"Think about what we've told you. We've waited this long. We can wait one more day for your decision.\" \"But we hope you'll help us find peace,\" Jasper added. His small figure barely more than a shimmer in the growing light. Within moments, they were gone completely, leaving me alone in Rita's living room with only the stopped clock and the lingering chill in the air as evidence they'd been there at all. I sat in the armchair for a long time, watching the room brighten as morning arrived. Everything they'd told me swirled through my mind. Their deaths, their decades of imprisonment, Rita's protective measures, and their desperate need for freedom. The house felt different now. Not threatening, but heavy with the weight of their story. I understood why Rita had carried this burden in silence, why she'd never told me the truth. How do you explain to a child that three murdered souls live in your house, that your nightly ritual keeps them contained? But I wasn't a child anymore. I was 28 years old and these spirits had trusted me with their truth. They weren't asking for revenge or justice. Those concepts had no meaning for people who'd been dead for 70 years. They were asking for release, for the chance to move on to whatever came next. The thought of burning down Rita's house made my chest tight. This place held so many memories, so much family history. But what good were those memories if they came at the cost of keeping three innocent souls trapped forever? I thought about Chelsea's attempts to escape, about two little boys who died because their father couldn't cope with what war had done to him. I thought about Rita spending decades managing a situation she never should have had to handle alone. By the time the sun was fully up, my decision was made. The Wong family, Chelsea, Hayden and Jasper, had suffered enough. They deserved their freedom even if it meant destroying the last physical connection I had to my grandmother. I would help them find peace. I woke with purpose burning in my chest, the kind that comes from finally knowing what needs to be done. The guest bedroom felt different in the morning light. Not haunted, just temporary. Everything here was temporary now. The hardware store on Pine Street opened at 8:00. I arrived 15 minutes later, parking near the entrance and walking straight to the back where they kept the automotive supplies. Three red plastic gasoline containers sat on the metal shelving, each holding five gallons. I grabbed two of them, their empty weight surprisingly light in my hands. The clerk behind the counter was a middle-aged man with grease under his fingernails who barely looked up from his newspaper. He rang up the containers without comment, probably assuming I needed fuel for a lawnmower or generator. If only it were that simple. \"That'll be $34.50,\" he said. I handed him two 20s and pocketed the change, carrying the containers out to my car. They fit easily in the trunk alongside the emergency kit I'd inherited from Rita. Everything about this felt surreal. Buying supplies to destroy my own home like I was picking up groceries. The gas station across town had the oldest pumps, the kind where you could pay cash without anyone asking questions. I filled both containers, the gasoline smell sharp and chemical in the cool morning air. The weight difference was dramatic now. Each container required both hands to lift into the trunk. Back at the house, I started the harder task of deciding what to save. Rita's photo albums came first. I pulled them from the living room bookshelf. Their leather covers worn smooth from decades of handling. The oldest one contained pictures of Rita as a young woman, standing in front of the house when the paint was fresh and the garden was just dirt patches. Another held photos of my mother's childhood, birthday parties in the backyard, Christmas mornings in the living room where I'd sat with the spirits just hours ago. I found a cardboard box in the kitchen and carefully placed the albums inside, wrapping them in dish towels to prevent damage. Rita's important papers went in next. Birth certificates, insurance policies, the deed to the house that would soon be meaningless.... her jewelry box from the bedroom dresser, small enough to fit in my jacket pocket; a wooden carving of a horse that I'd noticed on the mantelpiece, wondering now if Marvin had made it during one of his woodworking sessions with Hayden. The hardest decision was Rita's armchair. I ran my hand over the worn fabric, remembering all the evenings she'd sat there reading, all the times I'd curled up next to it as a child while she told me stories. But there was no way to save furniture. The chair would burn with everything else. I loaded the box into my car, arranging it carefully on the passenger seat. Then I sat in the driver's seat with the engine off, staring at Mariah's phone number written on a scrap of paper. This conversation would hurt her, but she deserved to know. She'd been searching for answers for 70 years. Rita's kitchen phone felt heavy in my hand as I dialed. Three rings, then her familiar voice. \"Hello?\" \"Mariah, this is Dakota. We spoke yesterday about Hayden Wong.\" \"Oh, yes, dear. Did you find him? Did you give him my message?\" I closed my eyes, gripping the phone tighter. \"Mariah, I need to tell you something difficult, about your brother and his family.\" \"What about them? Are they all right?\" \"They're not all right, Mariah. They died a long time ago, here in this house, in 1953.\" The silence stretched so long I thought she'd hung up. Then I heard her breathing, shaky and thin. \"That's not possible,\" she whispered. \"I would've known. Someone would've told me.\" \"Nobody knew. There were no police reports, no investigation. It happened here and they... they stayed here.\" \"How do you know this?\" I couldn't tell her about the spirits, about Rita's protective rituals, about conversations with the dead. \"I found records, evidence. Maria, your brother was struggling after the war. He hurt his family, then himself.\" Her sob came through the phone like a physical blow. \"I knew something was wrong when they stopped writing, when I couldn't find them. I knew, but I kept hoping.\" \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry you had to wait this long for answers.\" She cried quietly for several minutes while I stood in Rita's kitchen, watching dust motes drift through the afternoon light. Finally, she spoke again. \"Thank you for telling me. I've been looking for them my whole life. At least now I know.\" \"They loved you, Maria. That much I'm certain of.\" \"Yes,\" she said softly. \"Yes, they did.\" After we hung up, I sat at the kitchen table with my head in my hands. Another person's life forever changed by what had happened in this house. But at least her searching could end now. The afternoon passed quickly as I made final preparations. I walked through each room, touching walls and door frames, memorizing details I'd taken for granted. The kitchen where Rita had taught me to make pancakes, the living room where we'd played board games during rainy afternoons, the guest bedroom where I'd spent countless nights, never knowing three spirits watched over me. I saved the basement for last. The wooden steps creaked under my feet as I descended into the cool darkness, pulling the string to turn on the bare bulb. Cardboard boxes lined the walls, filled with Christmas decorations and old clothes. A workbench sat against the far wall, hand tools arranged neatly on a pegboard, everything covered in a fine layer of dust, untouched since Rita's death. This would all burn tonight, decades of accumulated memories reduced to ash and smoke. Back upstairs, I carried my box of saved items to the car, arranging everything carefully in the back seat. The gasoline container sat ready in the trunk. I had matches in my pocket, the same wooden matches Rita used to light candles during power outages. The sun was setting now, painting the house's white siding golden in the fading light. I stood on the front porch, keys in my hand, looking at the place that had shaped so much of my childhood. Rita had loved this house, had sacrificed years of her life protecting the souls trapped inside it. Now I would destroy it to set them free. My hands shook as I unlocked the front door one last time. The wooden cross hung right-side up, waiting for tonight's ritual. But this time, the ritual would be different. This time, it would be the last. I stepped inside and closed the door behind me, leaving my car packed and ready in the driveway. There would be no turning back now. The spirits were counting on me, and I wouldn't fail them the way their father had failed them, the way the world had failed them for 70 years. The grandfather clock still read 4:27. In a few hours, time would start moving again for the Wong family. I just had to find the courage to light the match. My hands wouldn't stop shaking as I reached for the deadbolt. The brass mechanism felt cold against my fingertips, and for a moment, I hesitated. Seventy years. That's how long the Wong family had been waiting for this moment. I turned the lock with a sharp click that seemed to echo through the entire house. The wooden cross hung at eye level, its familiar weight something I'd felt countless times before.But this time, instead of flipping it upside down, I grasped it and slowly rotated it until it sat right-side up. The moment it settled into position, something shifted. The air itself felt different, lighter, like a held breath had finally been released or a tight fist had opened after decades of clenching. The oppressive weight I'd never consciously noticed lifted from my shoulders, and I realized the house had been holding something back all this time. Now that barrier was gone. \"Thank you.\" I turned to find Chelsea standing behind me in the entryway, but she looked different now, more solid, more real. The translucent quality that had made her seem like a projection was gone, replaced by the appearance of an actual person. Her floral dress had color I hadn't seen before, faded blues and yellows that looked like they'd been washed many times, but still held traces of their original brightness. Hayden appeared beside her, no longer the flickering image from our previous encounters. His short pants and button-up shirt looked crisp, his hair neatly combed, his dark eyes bright with something I could only describe as relief. Jasper materialized next to his brother, smaller and younger, but with the same sense of peace radiating from him. \"You did it,\" Hayden said, his voice clear and strong, instead of the whisper I'd grown accustomed to. \"We can feel it. The barriers are gone.\" Chelsea stepped closer, and I could see tears in her eyes, real tears that caught the light from the overhead fixture. \"We've waited so long for someone to understand, to help us.\" \"Rita wanted to,\" Jasper added, his child's voice carrying a wisdom that seemed far beyond his six years. \"But she couldn't. She was protecting everyone.\" I nodded, not trusting my voice. The gasoline containers waited in my car trunk and matches sat heavy in my pocket. There was still work to do. \"I need to get the gasoline,\" I managed to say. Chelsea's expression grew solemn. \"We know what comes next. We're ready.\" I walked to my car on unsteady legs, retrieved both red containers from the trunk and carried them back to the house. The weight of them felt enormous, not just physically, but emotionally. Each step brought me closer to destroying the place that had sheltered three generations of my family. The Wong family watched as I unscrewed the first container's cap. The sharp smell of gasoline filled the entryway, acrid and chemical. I started in the basement, pouring the fuel across the concrete floor, around the Christmas decorations that would never see another holiday, over the workbench where someone had once built things with their hands. Back on the main floor, I continued through the kitchen, splashing gasoline across the yellow wallpaper, the linoleum floor, the cabinets that had held Rita's dishes. The fumes made my eyes water, but I kept going. The living room came next. Rita's armchair, the bookshelves, the coffee table where the spirits had first appeared to me in their full forms. Hayden, Jasper, and Chelsea followed my progress through each room, never speaking, but always present. They didn't look afraid. If anything, they seemed calm, patient, ready for what was coming. I climbed the stairs with the second container, dousing the hallway, the guest bedroom where I'd slept, the bathroom, Rita's bedroom. Each room received its share of the fuel that would consume decades of memories, photographs, furniture, and secrets. When both containers were empty, I stood in the living room where everything had started. The grandfather clock still read 4:27, frozen in time just as the Wong family had been frozen in death. The gasoline fumes were overwhelming now, making the air shimmer like heat waves. Chelsea stood near the mantelpiece where I'd found the wooden horse carving. \"This house held us for so long. Now it will let us go.\" I pulled the matchbook from my pocket, my hands steadier now than they'd been all evening. The decision was made. There was no going back. \"Are you sure?\" I asked, though I already knew the answer. \"We're sure,\" Hayden said. \"We've been sure for 70 years.\" I struck the match against the rough strip on the matchbook cover. The small flame flickered to life, bright and orange in the gasoline-heavy air. For a moment, I held it, watching the fire consume the wooden stick, feeling its heat against my fingers. Then I dropped it. The flame hit the fuel-soaked floor and exploded outward in a rush of heat and light. Fire raced across the hardwood, up the walls, spreading faster than I'd expected. The house began to burn with a hunger that seemed almost alive. I ran for the front door as flames climbed the curtains and reached for the ceiling. The heat followed me, pushing against my back as I stumbled outside and across the street. Only when I reached the sidewalk on the opposite side did I turn around. The house was already engulfed. Fire poured from the windows, reached through the roof, turned the white siding black with smoke and ash. The structure that had stood for decades, that had sheltered my family and imprisoned another, was being consumed by flames that danced and roared against the dark sky. I stood on the sidewalk, watching the flames tear through every room I'd known since childhood. The heat reached me even from across the street, waves of it rolling over my face while smoke billowed into the night sky.Rita's house, my house, was disappearing piece by piece, taking with it the yellow kitchen wallpaper, the grandfather clock, the narrow staircase where I'd climbed countless times. The fire moved faster than I'd expected. What had been white siding minutes ago was now charred black, and the windows glowed orange from within like jack-o'-lantern eyes. I could hear wood cracking and splitting, the sound of decades collapsing in on themselves. Then I saw them. In the upstairs window, the same guest bedroom window where I'd first glimpsed Hayden's reflection 20 years ago, three figures appeared. Not solid like they'd been inside the house, but clear enough that I recognized them immediately. Chelsea stood in the center, her floral dress visible even through the smoke. Hayden was to her right, small and serious, while Jasper pressed close to his mother's other side. They looked different now, peaceful. The hollow sadness that had marked their faces was gone, replaced by something I could only call relief. Chelsea lifted her hand first, a slow, deliberate wave. Hayden followed, raising his small palm toward the window glass. Even Jasper, shy as he'd been, lifted his hand in farewell. I raised my own hand without thinking, pressing it against the night air between us. The gesture felt enormous, final. Not just goodbye, but acknowledgment. I saw you, I heard you, I helped you. The roof chose that moment to give way. A section near the chimney collapsed inward with a thunderous crash, sending sparks shooting up like fireworks. When I looked back at the window, the three figures were fading, dissolving into the smoke and flames as if they'd been made of the same substance all along. Something shifted inside my chest. Not the tight anxiety I'd carried since finding that first letter, but its opposite, a loosening, an opening. The weight I hadn't fully realized I'd been carrying lifted away, leaving me feeling strangely light. It wasn't just my own burden disappearing. Something had lifted from the property itself, from the very ground where the house stood. The oppressive feeling that had always hung over this place, subtle but constant, was gone. Sirens wailed in the distance, growing louder. Red and blue lights flickered between the trees as the firetrucks rounded the corner onto Maple Street. They moved fast, but I could see they were already too late. The house was too far gone. The flames too established. They'd saved the neighboring properties maybe, but Rita's house was lost. The first truck pulled up with a screech of brakes. Firefighters jumped out, already unrolling hoses, shouting instructions to each other. One of them jogged over to me, a tall man with a soot-streaked face. \"Anyone inside?\" He called over the noise of the fire. \"No,\" I said. \"Just me, and I got out.\" \"What happened?\" I'd prepared for this question during the long afternoon of planning. \"Candle,\" I said, loud enough to be heard over the flames. \"I knocked it over by accident. Everything went up so fast.\" He nodded grimly. \"Old houses like this, they go quick. Wood's dry, lots of fuel.\" He was already turning back toward the trucks. \"Stay back, okay? We'll get this under control.\" I watched them work, directing streams of water at the flames, but it felt almost ceremonial now. The house was beyond saving. The fire had done what it needed to do, and now it would burn itself out on the bones of the structure. More trucks arrived, police cars, an ambulance, though nobody needed medical attention. The street filled with flashing lights and the controlled chaos of emergency response. Neighbors emerged from their houses, standing in robes and hastily thrown-on clothes, watching the spectacle. But I barely registered any of it. My attention stayed fixed on the burning structure, watching Rita's life and mine turn to ash and memory. The living room where I'd sat in her armchair just hours ago, the kitchen where she'd taught me to make her terrible coffee, the guest bedroom where I'd lain awake as a child, sensing things I couldn't name. It took three hours for the flames to die down to glowing embers. The firefighters kept working, dousing hot spots, making sure the fire wouldn't spread or reignite. By the time they finished, nothing remained but a blackened foundation and scattered piles of charred wood. The chimney stood alone like a monument, smoke still rising from the ruins. I answered more questions from a police officer, routine stuff about insurance, about where I'd be staying, about the accident. He seemed satisfied with my answers. House fires happened. Candles got knocked over. Old houses burned fast and hot. When the last firetruck pulled away, I found myself alone on the sidewalk again. The neighbors had gone back inside. The street was quiet except for the occasional pop and hiss from the cooling ruins. Standing there in the darkness, I felt something I hadn't expected, peace. Deep, genuine peace, like I'd just finished a task that had been waiting my entire life to be completed. The Wong family was free. After 70 years of being trapped in that house, of being contained by Rita's protective barriers, they were finally able to move on to whatever came next. And somehow, I felt Rita's approval too. Not her physical presence. She was gone, truly gone. But something like her satisfaction settling over me. She'd known. All those years of teaching me the ritual, of keeping the secret, of carrying that burden alone, she'd known this day would come. She'd known I would be the one to finally set them free. She'd been protecting me, just like Chelsea said, waiting until I was old enough, mature enough, ready enough to handle the truth and make the right choice. Rita had seen something in me that I was only now beginning to understand. I walked back to my car, my footsteps echoing in the empty street, the cardboard box of saved items sat in the back seat, photos, papers, Rita's jewelry, the wooden horse Marvin had carved for Hayden before the war changed him, pieces of the past worth preserving. But the ghosts? I was leaving behind."
