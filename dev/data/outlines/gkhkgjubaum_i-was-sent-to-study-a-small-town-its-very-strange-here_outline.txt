1. Title
- I Was Sent to Study a Small Town. It's Very Strange Here.

2. Main Characters
- Frederick Armstrong — narrator; Regional Herald reporter, professional curiosity and moral center of the story.
- Avery Day — innkeeper/proprietor of the Harksworth Inn; outwardly polite, complicit caretaker of the town’s routine.
- Jasmine Ortiz — this year’s “Luckiest Citizen” recipient; young bank manager, mother; moves from fear to resigned acceptance.
- Kyle Ortiz — Jasmine’s husband; Forestry Service employee, under the Luckbringer’s influence.
- Sadie Ortiz — Jasmine and Kyle’s young daughter; innocent witness.
- Glenn (Glenn Dominguez) — the town’s oldest resident and primary expositor of Harksworth’s history; bearer of guilt and memory.
- Jimmy Bailey, Irene Willis, and other residents — a collectively evasive community (appear as a unified chorus protecting the secret).
- The Luckbringer — unnamed supernatural entity (antagonist by implication): offers prosperity in exchange for an annual human tribute.

3. Setting
- Harksworth: an isolated mountain village that appears unnaturally pristine — manicured gardens, freshly painted houses, perfect main street.
- Key locations in Harksworth: Harksworth Inn (room 7), Maple Street and Pine Street (residences), general store, village center / gazebo / platform, the forest path at the village edge.
- Outside: mountain road/bus stop (arrival and departure), Regional Herald newsroom (final resolution).

4. Narrative Structure
- Exposition
  - Arrival in Harksworth; first impressions of uncanny perfection and coordinated evasiveness. Assignment context: fluff piece about “Luckiest Citizen Award.”
- Rising action
  - Series of stilted interviews; innkeeper Avery’s odd knowledge; discovery that residents are prepped and evasive; meeting Jasmine (initial terror & plea to leave); meeting Glenn (elder) who reveals the true nature of the award and the town’s pact.
- Climax
  - The public ceremony at sunset; Jasmine, serenely compelled, walks into the forest and disappears — the ritualized fulfillment of the town’s annual tribute.
- Falling action
  - Night vigil and empty forest; narrator’s attempt to process and decide; Avery’s final warning and implicit threat; internal debate about exposing the truth.
- Resolution
  - Narrator chooses not to publish: locks notes away, returns to normal reporting; carries the secret as a personal burden and silence.

6. Emotional Arc
- Curiosity / Professional optimism — arrives expecting a fluff piece.
- Unease and suspicion — town’s perfection and evasiveness unsettle him.
- Determination — resolve to dig deeper after coordinated obfuscation.
- Alarm and empathy — Jasmine’s desperate plea and evidence of manipulation stir compassion.
- Shock and horror — Glenn’s account of a ritualized bargain, decades of deaths.
- Frustration and helplessness — failed attempts to save Jasmine and to find lawful recourse.
- Grief and moral torment — witnessing the ceremony and disappearance; burden of bearing the truth.
- Resignation / Complicity by silence — pragmatically choosing to stay silent for self- and communal-preservation; carries guilt and knowledge forward.

7. Themes and Motifs
- Themes
  - Moral compromise for survival — community chooses prosperity over individual lives; collective complicity.
  - The cost of truth — exposing the pact risks widespread harm (past reprisals demonstrate cost).
  - Secrecy and tradition as social control — ritual and ceremony normalize atrocity; appearances protect the mechanism.
  - Isolation and vulnerability — geographic and technological isolation amplifies the town’s ability to enforce the bargain.
  - Limits of journalism/ethics — narrator wrestles with duty to truth versus responsibility for others’ safety.
  - Human agency vs supernatural coercion — “choice” under influence; voluntary appearance masks exploitation.
- Motifs
  - Perfection / curated façade — the town’s manicured look as a mask for atrocity.
  - Ritual & ceremony — award pageantry as moral laundering of the sacrifice.
  - The forest / trees — threshold to the unknown, site of disappearance and hunger.
  - Photographs and records — images as both cover story and memory; Glenn’s photos function as historical evidence.
  - Time and cycles — annual repetition (the pact’s cycle, generations), the steady cadence of the ceremony.
  - Food & domestic hospitality — tea, whiskey, innkeeping as settings where truth is revealed and hidden.
  - Silence & coordinated speech — rehearsed answers, communal silence, and the locked manila folder as symbolic containment.

Notes / Analytical observations
- The story uses a slow-burn investigative frame to reveal moral horror: the surface-level quaintness of small-town life paradoxically conceals systemic atrocity.
- Glenn functions as the moral conscience and necessary expositor; Avery and the villagers illustrate pragmatic complicity — both made sympathetic and culpable.
- The Luckbringer is never described directly; its agency is inferred, which amplifies dread and allows the townspeople’s decisions to be the moral focus.
- The narrator’s ultimate decision—choosing silence—is the thematic crux: the story interrogates whether some truths are worth the collateral price, and how institutions (and individuals) negotiate that calculus.
