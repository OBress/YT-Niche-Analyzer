- Title
  - I Was a Marine at the DMZ in 1989. I Saw Something TERRIFYING.

- Main Characters
  - Eddie Day (narrator) — Marine on patrol; sole surviving team member; later assumes identity Michael Harrison and lives in hiding.

  - Christian Hoffman — translator; talks to the girl; becomes ill and is removed.
  - Julian Burgess — youngest team member; carries the girl back; becomes ill and is removed.
  - The Girl / “the subject” — appears as a bloodstained young girl in a hanbok; later implied to be a supernatural entity (Kumiho-like).
  - Colonel Hunt & Major Payne — higher-ranking officers whose contradictory radio orders and later involvement indicate an official containment response.
  - Michael Garrison — checkpoint/security at Camp Liberty who treats the girl as an asset/package.
  - Paul — civilian contact in the U.S. (police connection) who helps Eddie disappear.
  - Kim — fixer in Seoul who arranges documents and extraction.
  - Father McKenzie — chaplain who provides blessed rounds and spiritual support.
  - Unnamed specialists/contractors — hazmat/containment teams and government/civilian experts who take over Building 7.

- Setting
  - Time: October 1989 (initial events), then an extended period spanning years afterward through the narrator’s flight to the U.S. and long-term hiding (up to ~8 years later).
  - Places:
    - Sector Seven, DMZ (Korea) — ridge lines, fence, patrol route.
    - Camp Liberty — base with normal operations that shifts into a containment site (notably Building 7).
    - Building 7 — windowless restricted facility used to isolate the girl/subject.
    - Observation post / abandoned Korean position — where the narrator watches base activity.
    - Transit via Seoul/Incheon → Yokota → USA — extraction and cover routes.
    - Various U.S. locations — Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Detroit; Paul’s safehouse.
    - Glacier Valley Community College (final scene) — campus where final encounter occurs.

- Narrative Structure
  - Exposition
    - Briefing and departure from Camp Liberty; introductions to team roles and patrol routine; landscape of Sector Seven; time: 00:00:00–00:10:00.
  - Rising Action
    - Routine patrol disturbed by an anomalous fog moving against wind, loss of radio contact, discovery of mutilated North Korean soldiers, the crying child; decision to bring the girl to base; conflicting orders over radio; time: 00:24:01–00:48:00.
  - Climax
    - Base response escalates: the girl is isolated in Building 7; teammates become ill, placed in quarantine, transported; narrator overhears references to folklore/supernatural (Kumiho) and containment; narrator flees to avoid being taken — containment and deaths culminate in Building 7 burning and recovery of bodies; time: 01:22:01–01:43:00.
  - Falling Action
    - Narrator’s escape off base, covert extraction to Seoul, travel to the U.S., assisted disappearances, living under assumed identities, repeated surveillance by federal teams; long-term psychological fallout; time: 01:43:01–01:53:00 (and covers years).
  - Resolution (ambiguous / cliffhanger)
    - Years later, narrator (as Michael Harrison) works nights, still hunted; final scene shows the same girl reappearing on campus; narrator arms himself with blessed silver rounds preparing for confrontation — unresolved ending. (Final seconds.)

  - 01:45:01–01:53:43 — Building 7 fire / containment breach; teams recover multiple bodies; Colonel Hunt confirms teammates died; narrator realizes systemic cover-up and flees Korea — sequence then compresses into long-term escape, clandestine travel, return to the U.S., and years of hiding, culminating in final campus confrontation.

- Emotional Arc
  - Anticipation / professional focus — opening: routine patrol discipline, methodical checks.
  - Curiosity → unease — when fog behaves oddly and radio drops out.
  - Horror / revulsion — discovery of mutilated soldiers, surgical-like wounds.
  - Compassion / protectiveness — toward the bloodstained girl (human instinct to help).
  - Confusion → betrayal — conflicting command orders; debrief minimizing the girl’s testimony.
  - Anger / dread — realization leadership is hiding facts; teammates fall ill.
  - Panic → determination — decision to flee rather than be contained.
  - Grief / survivor’s guilt — after teammates die or are taken to their deaths.
  - Paranoia / isolation — years of hiding under false identities; watched by government agents.
  - Resolve / readiness — final scene where narrator prepares to confront the entity directly.

- Themes and Motifs
  - Supernatural vs. Institutional Denial
    - The narrative juxtaposes an impossible, folkloric threat (Kumiho-like entity) with a military/government drive to contain, label, and suppress.
  - Survivor guilt and moral cost of compassion
    - The narrator’s empathy for the child leads to catastrophic consequences for his team; guilt drives his later actions and isolation.
  - Secrecy and bureaucratic cover-up
    - Repeated contradictory orders, unmarked transports, restricted access, and suppression of facts emphasize institutional secrecy.
  - Identity and exile
    - Repeated identity changes (Eddie Day → Michael Harrison), life in hiding, and loss of a previous life.
  - Folklore and cultural collision
    - The Kumiho motif (shape-shifting fox-woman) is invoked; Western military systems misinterpret or suppress cultural/supernatural explanations.
  - Fog / obscuration as symbol
    - The unnatural fog both conceals supernatural danger and symbolizes the opacity of truth beneath official responses.
  - Child/monstrous ambiguity
    - The subject’s appearance as an innocent girl masks predatory, contagious properties — unsettling the instinct to protect.
  - Radio/static / communication breakdown
    - Static, conflicting transmissions, and jammed frequencies mirror fractured authority and unreliable truth.
  - Blood and the unnatural wound pattern
    - Repeated images of blood, precise three-pronged claw marks, and minimal external bleeding underscore the non-natural threat.
  - Containment vs. humanity
    - The choice to contain (and in practice to kill or silence) rather than explain or heal raises ethical questions about who is protected and at what cost.

- Narrative notes / final impression
  - The story is structured as a first-person survival/horror confession that starts with a tactical military patrol and expands into a long-term psychological and institutional thriller. It ends on a deliberately unresolved cliffhanger: years later, the narrator encounters the same figure and prepares to fight — leaving the reader with lingering ambiguity about whether the threat can be destroyed, contained, or will continue to haunt him.
