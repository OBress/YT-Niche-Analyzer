1. Title
- I Moved Into a House in Japan. Something is Living Under the Floorboards.

2. Main Characters
- Marshall Walker — narrator; American engineer who inherits the house; protagonist and viewpoint character.  
- Uncle Jeff (Jeff Walker) — estranged uncle, property owner, missing/murder victim.  
- Levi Ferguson — Japanese-based attorney handling the estate.  
- Detective Nakamura — local Japanese detective who leads the on-site investigation.  
- Detective Bell — investigator on the missing-persons case (voicemail contact).  
- Denise McLaughlin — woman who disappeared 20 years earlier; later identified as the body sealed in the wall (likely the “woman” apparition).  
- Apparitions / Supernatural figures — unnamed woman in white (hair obscuring face) and a hollow-eyed boy; recurring antagonistic presences.  
- Minor: local police, forensics team, Marshall’s boss Elaine, coworkers, neighbors.

3. Setting
- Primary: Remote traditional Japanese house in rural Gifu Prefecture — isolated, overgrown garden, sagging roof, tatami rooms, attic, main room with floorboards.  
- Secondary: Mountain roads and clearing leading to the house; small local police station; Tokyo (Marshall’s apartment and departure point); Seattle — Marshall’s new life and apartment after returning to the U.S.

4. Narrative Structure
- Exposition
  - Marshall receives a heavy envelope from Japan revealing he inherited his estranged Uncle Jeff’s rural house and learns Jeff is missing; Marshall decides to see the property. Sets up past estrangement and mystery.
- Rising Action
  - Marshall drives to the remote Gifu property; discovers signs of violence and neglect; finds Jeff’s recent letter warning not to stay after dark and describing “the woman and child” in the walls; chooses to stay overnight despite the warning.
  - Strange phenomena escalate after dark: attic footsteps, sudden temperature drop, frost inside, locked/immovable doors and windows, disappearances of keys/phone battery drain, and repeated sightings of a woman in white and a hollow-eyed child whose mouth opens in a silent scream.
- Climax
  - Dawn release and desperate flight: Marshall survives the night of terror; police arrive and reveal they found Uncle Jeff’s decomposed body under the floorboards in the exact spot where Marshall slept, and later a long-sealed body (Denise McLaughlin) in a wall cavity.
- Falling Action
  - Investigation reveals the house’s dark history and a likely connection between Jeff’s discovery of Denise and his murder. Marshall returns to the U.S., attempts to rebuild life in Seattle but continues to experience apparitions and PTSD-like symptoms.
- Resolution
  - No neat closure. The physical house is demolished months later, but Marshall remains haunted; he moves and attempts to create distance, but the supernatural/psychological effects persist. The story ends ambiguously — survival rather than resolution.

7. Themes and Motifs
- Themes
  - Inheritance as burden: inheritance brings not just property but secrets, responsibility, and danger.  
  - Family estrangement and guilt: past conflict with Uncle Jeff and the narrator’s guilt about absence and ignorance.  
  - The past trapped in the present: physical sealing of victims (under floorboards/walls) as a metaphor for buried crimes and secrets resurfacing.  
  - Rationalism vs. superstition: engineering/rational narrator confronts events outside logical explanation; rural superstition and history clash with modern skepticism.  
  - Entrapment and helplessness: literal (sealed doors, trapped bodies) and psychological entrapment (haunting memories, PTSD).  
  - The cost of curiosity: seeking answers exposes Marshall to mortal and psychological danger.  
  - Incomplete justice and unresolved trauma: crime investigation yields facts but not full closure; lasting effects remain.
- Motifs / Recurring imagery
  - Silence (unnatural absence of ambient sound) — underscores isolation and foreboding.  
  - Cold/frost inside the house during summer — immediate supernatural marker of the apparition’s presence.  
  - White dress and long black hair — the woman’s recurring visual signature (links to classic ghost imagery).  
  - The child with hollow eyes and silent scream — corrupted innocence and emotional amplification without sound.  
  - Sealed, enclosed spaces — floorboards, wall cavities, attic — representing buried secrets and literal imprisonment.  
  - Time of night vs dawn — danger tied to darkness and release tied to sunlight.  
  - Letters as catalysts — Jeff’s letter transforms suspicion into action and provides a textual bridge to the past.
