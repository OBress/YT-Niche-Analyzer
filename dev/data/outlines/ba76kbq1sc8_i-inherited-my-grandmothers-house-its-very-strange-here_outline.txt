1. Title
- I Inherited My Grandmother's House. It's Very Strange Here.

2. Main Characters
- Dakota Payne — narrator; Rita’s grandchild, inheritor of the house, protagonist who must decide what to do.
- Rita — Dakota’s grandmother (deceased); longtime owner of the Victorian, keeper of the ritual that contains the spirits.
- Hayden Wong — ghost of an eight-year-old boy who appears to Dakota; one of the three trapped spirits.
- Jasper Wong — Hayden’s younger brother; child spirit.
- Chelsea Wong — the boys’ mother; spirit who explains their history and asks for release.
- Marvin Wong — father (antagonistic off-page figure); perpetrator of the murders and suicide (died 1953).
- Mariah Burns — Marvin’s sister; aunt who searched for the family and later contacts Dakota by phone about a letter.
- Dakota’s Mother — minor role; previously dismissed Dakota’s childhood sighting as imagination.
- Firefighters / police / neighbors — peripheral, appear in aftermath.

3. Setting
- Primary: A tall, narrow Victorian house (family home) on Maple Street — three generations of family history, worn but familiar. Interior spaces of note: entryway with wooden cross and stopped grandfather clock, living room with armchair and mantel, guest bedroom (window where Hayden was seen), kitchen, basement, and attic/household objects.
- Temporal: Present day (2023) frame; frequent flashback to 20 years earlier (early childhood) and backstory set in early 1950s (1952–1953).
- Secondary locales: hardware store (Pine Street), gas station, neighborhood street (scene of burning and emergency response).

4. Narrative Structure
- Exposition
  - Dakota returns to the Victorian three weeks after Rita’s funeral; sensory details (lavender, stopped clock, peeling paint); recalls Rita’s nightly ritual (flip the cross upside-down “to keep them in”) and childhood memory of seeing a boy in the guest room window.
- Rising Action
  - Dakota settles in, receives a mysterious envelope addressed to “Hayden Wong” with a letter dated decades earlier; phone call with Mariah Burns that insists Hayden lived at the address in 1952; Dakota investigates documents and finds no record of the Wong family; nighttime footsteps and apparition of Hayden lead to the revelation of three spirits (Hayden, Jasper, Chelsea) trapped in the house.
- Climax
  - The spirits tell their origin: Marvin killed his family and himself in 1953; Rita contained them with rituals and the upside-down cross. The spirits ask Dakota to flip the cross right-side-up and burn the house to release them. Dakota chooses to help and prepares to burn the house.
- Falling Action
  - Dakota gathers petrol and salvages irreplaceable items, informs Mariah, pours gasoline through the house, flips the cross, ignites the fuel, and runs outside as the house erupts in flames; spirits appear in the upstairs window to wave farewell as the fire consumes the house.
- Resolution
  - Firefighters extinguish the blaze; house is destroyed; Dakota feels peace and closure — the Wong family is freed, Rita’s protective burden is ended, Dakota departs with a saved box of family keepsakes.

7. Themes and Motifs
- Themes
  - Duty and legacy — Rita’s silent stewardship and Dakota’s inherited responsibility to finish what Rita started.
  - Secrets and protection — concealment as a form of protection (Rita keeping the truth from Dakota to shield them) and how secrets can both harm and heal.
  - Memory and frozen time — the stopped clock (4:27) and the house as a repository of frozen events and unresolved trauma.
  - Sacrifice and moral choice — destroying personal/familial history to free others; weighing tangible legacy against human dignity.
  - Trauma and its afterlife — effects of war (Marvin’s PTSD), domestic violence, and the ways trauma can haunt places and people.
  - Release and purification — fire as destructive force but also as the means of release and rebirth for trapped spirits.
- Motifs / recurring images
  - The wooden cross and ritual (upside-down “to keep them in” / right-side-up to release).
  - Lavender scent — connection to Rita and domestic memory.
  - Stopped grandfather clock at 4:27 — time frozen at the moment of rupture.
  - Window reflection / the guest room window — threshold between worlds, first place Hayden appears.
  - Letters / postal anachronism — the envelope to Hayden and the phone call from Mariah that expose time dislocation and unresolved ties.
  - Photographs and heirlooms — tangible links to past lives (photo albums, wooden horse carving) that frame what is chosen to be saved.
  - Fire, gasoline, matches — elements of finality and cleansing; physical method that enacts moral decision.

Additional notes (narrative techniques and perspective)
- First-person, present-tense framing mixed with past-tense flashbacks — creates intimacy and immediacy, relies on sensory details to evoke memory and hauntings.
- The story balances domestic, mundane details (kitchen, wallpaper, errands) with supernatural exposition, making the uncanny feel embedded in ordinary life.
- Moral ambiguity is central: Dakota acts outside the law (arson) for an ethical goal (release of trapped souls), and the narrative frames this as compassionate and necessary, inviting readers to weigh legal/ethical norms against restorative justice for the wronged.
