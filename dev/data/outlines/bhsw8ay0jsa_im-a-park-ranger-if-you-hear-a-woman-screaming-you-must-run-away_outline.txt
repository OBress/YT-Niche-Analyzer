1. Title
- I'm a Park Ranger. If You Hear a Woman Screaming You Must RUN Away.

2. Main Characters
- Julian (narrator) — veteran park ranger, experienced, haunted by a similar encounter 15 years earlier; calm, methodical, carries institutional knowledge about an anomalous predator.
- Jasper — 24‑year‑old rookie ranger assigned to Julian’s sector; physically capable, inexperienced, initially rattled, grows into composure under Julian’s guidance.
- The Creature — a tall, inhuman predator that mimics human voices by manipulating severed heads; intelligent, ritualistic, patient, uses vocal lures to hunt.
- Victim(s) (implied/seen) — at least one woman displayed and hollowed in the clearing; references to five missing researchers from the prior incident.
- Supporting (brief) — Tom (Julian’s partner from 15 years ago; mentioned), Detective Morrison and the recovery/investigative team (arrive at the end).

3. Setting
- Blackwood section of Pine Ridge (dense pine/oak forest with thick undergrowth, a clearing used as the creature’s feeding ground).
- Late afternoon into early evening (shortening daylight, still visible but shadowy).
- Rural park infrastructure: trailhead, gravel access road, patrol vehicles, remote clearing.

4. Narrative Structure
- Exposition
  - Julian finishing reports at the station; receives Jasper’s urgent radio call about a woman screaming at Blackwood Trailhead; Julian’s internal recall of a similar incident 15 years earlier.
- Rising Action
  - Drive to the trailhead; arrival; Jasper describes the repeating voice and hour‑long pattern; Julian and Jasper enter dense woods, track the voice and piece together its mechanical repetition; Julian recounts his prior experience; they approach the clearing.
- Climax
  - Discovery of the suspended, surgically hollowed female corpse; realization the voice is a lure; the creature reveals itself, carrying the victim’s severed head and mimicking voices (including Julian’s old partner’s voice); confrontation escalates to shots fired.
- Falling Action
  - Creature is hit and then disintegrates unusually rapidly into white bones and black fluid; insect/forest noises return; Julian and Jasper process the event, call in recovery.
- Resolution
  - Recovery/investigative teams arrive; official procedures begin; Julian and Jasper keep the full truth to themselves (the creature’s nature remains off the record); life/guard duty continues — threat eliminated here, but uncertainty about wider danger remains.

5. Key Plot Points with timestamp ranges (approximate; total duration 6296 s ≈ 1:44:56)
- 00:00–02:00 — Opening: Julian writing reports; Jasper’s radio call interrupts with urgent plea for backup.
- 02:00–08:00 — Drive to Blackwood; Julian’s internal speculation and memory of a past similar incident.
- 08:00–18:00 — Arrival at trailhead; Jasper explains the hour‑long mechanical screaming; they decide to investigate together.
- 18:00–34:00 — Into the woods: voice repeats at consistent intervals; Julian recognizes mechanical pattern, recounts 15‑year‑old case; they track the sound.
- 34:00–46:00 — They locate the clearing; smell of decomposition; first sight of the impaled, hollowed female body suspended in branches.
- 46:00–58:00 — Voice stops and then resumes from different bearings; rustling indicates something hiding/positioning; Julian warns Jasper not to respond or run.
- 58:00–66:00 — The creature reveals itself: tall, wrong proportions, empty eye sockets; holds the severed head used as a vocal lure.
- 66:00–74:00 — Psychological manipulation: the severed head speaks (mechanical voice), the creature mimics others (including Tom’s voice) to unsettle Julian and Jasper.
- 74:00–76:30 — Confrontation: Julian shoots center mass; creature reacts; it advances.
- 76:30–79:00 — Jasper fires a headshot; creature collapses and rapidly decomposes into bones and black fluid.
- 79:00–90:00 — Immediate aftermath: silence returns; Julian and Jasper assess scene, call dispatch; Julian contemplates how to report.
- 90:00–104:56 — Recovery team and investigators arrive; official containment and documentation begin; Julian and Jasper share private understanding — the full truth stays between them.

6. Emotional Arc
- Calm/normality (Julian finishing reports) → Concern/urgency (Jasper’s radio tone; trip to trailhead)
- Growing unease → dread (mechanical repetition of voice, memory of past incident)
- Fear/terror (discovery of the displayed corpse; creature’s reveal; severed head speaking; manipulative taunts)
- Focused resolve (Julian’s controlled tactics; decision not to respond; tactical commands)
- Adrenal combat intensity (shooting and physical threat)
- Shocked relief (creature neutralized, rapid decomposition)
- Somber reflection and guarded responsibility (calling in authorities, agreeing to keep the full reality private)
- Lingering uncertainty (Julian’s awareness that more may exist elsewhere)

7. Themes and Motifs
- Themes
  - Imitation and the uncanny — the creature’s mimicry of human voices exposes the horror of a replication devoid of emotion.
  - Predation by deception — using familiar cues (human cries) as lures; trust exploited turns into danger.
  - Memory and trauma — Julian’s prior experience informs his decisions; past events haunt the present.
  - Duty and leadership — Julian’s responsibility to protect, to train/guide Jasper, and to contain knowledge for the public good.
  - Limits of official systems — bureaucracy, reports, and forensic procedures cannot fully account for anomalous experiences; the “true” story remains unofficial.
  - Nature as both sanctuary and stalking ground — the forest is beautiful and sacred yet hides ancient, methodical danger.
- Motifs
  - Repetition / 30‑second intervals — mechanical rhythm of the voice as a structural lure.
  - Voice and silence — calls for help versus manipulative mimicry; silence marking the creature’s attention or the moment before an attack.
  - Display and ritual — the impaled, hollowed corpses and arranged feeding spots function as both feeding and signaling behavior.
  - Decomposition / black fluid — unnatural decay as a physical sign of the creature’s otherness.
  - Light and shadow — late afternoon light, dappled canopy, and the way shadows mask or reveal danger.
  - Professional procedure vs. unspeakable truth — radios, reports, recovery teams contrasted with what rangers actually know.

Optional notes (narrative/structural observations)
- First‑person, linear recounting weaves present action with extended flashback/backstory (15‑year memory), which builds credibility and suspense through prior knowledge.
- The story balances procedural detail (ranger tactics, radio protocol) with visceral horror imagery to ground the supernatural elements.
- The ending leaves institutional ambiguity — the anomaly is locally contained but the larger implication (other creatures, wider range of activity) is left unresolved, preserving tension beyond the immediate narrative.
