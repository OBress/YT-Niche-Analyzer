1. Title
- I Lead Night Patrols in Afghanistan. Something is Hunting Us.

2. Main Characters
- Staff Sergeant Edward “Eddie” Bowen — narrator and patrol leader; competent, experienced, haunted survivor.
- Kyle (Dennis) — rookie, nervous, point man; psychically overwhelmed by the events.
- Raiden Warren — reliable, steady farm kid; perceptive (left letters describing premonitory sightings).
- Marvin — rookie; fires at the creature; panics when ineffective.
- Randy — rookie; killed early in the encounter.
- Jorge — squad member; calm before attack; last transmissions include terrified screaming.
- The Faceless Entity — tall, coat-like, smoke-like predator that ignores bullets, manipulates radios and perception.
- Captain Reeves — base officer who helps evacuate Bowen; skeptical.
- Major Kelly — battalion XO; enforces official narrative, threatens psychiatric detention.
- Dr. Winters — military psychologist; interprets events as trauma-induced hallucination / PTSD.
- Medic / Dr. Simmons / other medical staff — provide treatment, sedation, and tests.
- Families (e.g., the Warrens) — contact point that provides Raiden’s letters and humanizes the losses.

3. Setting
- Kalar Village (night): deserted mud‑brick village, market stalls left mid‑transaction, eerie silence, winding alleys that seem to shift — primary site of the horror.
- Drainage ditch/eastern sector of the mosque — where Kyle hides.
- Outskirts / path to extraction point — flight through maze-like streets, dawn break.
- Helicopter, field medic area, base medical facility / conference room — rescue and debrief/interrogation setting.
- Bowen’s apartment / transition housing — months-later aftermath, research and obsession; location of the printed report and radio hauntings.
- Timeframe: single night patrol (night → dawn) and the subsequent months of medical processing and discharge.

4. Narrative Structure
- Exposition
  - Briefing and departure for a routine night sweep of Kalar Village; Bowen introduces the rookies and the mission parameters; narrator senses something is wrong.
- Rising Action
  - The village is unnaturally empty and silent; tension builds as rookies grow jittery; Kyle fires at an apparent figure without confirmation; subsequent sightings escalate; peripheral movement and radio static create paranoia.
- Climax
  - The faceless entity attacks: Randy is thrown; Marvin’s bullets pass through the creature; rapid disappearances of squad members; Jorge’s terrified radio scream; Bowen is chased through a shifting village; Kyle collapses in front of the predator; Bowen flees terrified.
- Falling Action
  - Dawn arrives and the creature withdraws; Bowen is found alive, evacuated by helicopter; medical exams follow; interrogation and skepticism from higher command; Dr. Winters diagnoses PTSD.
- Resolution
  - Official narrative frames the incident as a Taliban ambush with bodies removed; Bowen is medicated and discharged; he obsessively researches similar incidents, documents his account, hides the folder, and remains haunted by voices and survivor guilt — vowing to keep the truth.

- 68:00–77:41 (4080–4661s) — Medical debriefing and interrogation; Dr. Winters diagnoses PTSD; official report frames incident as enemy ambush; Bowen is sedated, later discharged; months-long aftermath, research, documentation, and obsession.

6. Emotional Arc (Bowen’s trajectory)
- Professional confidence / routine command in briefing.
- Prickling unease as the environment readjusts expectations.
- Frustration and anger (after Kyle fires without authorization).
- Rising dread and confusion as unexplainable events escalate.
- Terror and primal flight during the creature’s attack and the chase.
- Overwhelming guilt and survivor’s despair after dawn and rescue.
- Isolation, disbelief, and institutional betrayal during debriefing/interrogation.
- Obsession, determination, and quiet defiance as Bowen documents and hides the truth; persistent hauntedness (voices, insomnia).

7. Themes and Motifs
- Trauma, survivor’s guilt, and memory
  - Bowen’s repeated insistence that he alone remained, the mental collapse cast as “unreliable memory,” and his obsessive documentation.
- Unreliable perception vs. institutional narrative
  - The clash between Bowen’s firsthand account and the military’s official, convenient explanation (Taliban ambush / PTSD).
- Silence and absence
  - The empty, soundless village, abandoned market stalls, and missing bodies emphasize an unnatural erasure.
- Face / facelessness and the void
  - The creature’s lack of a face (a void) as a motif of unknowable evil and the erasure of identity (the missing men become absent not only physically but narratively).
- Radio and technology as conduits of horror
  - Radios replay the voices of the missing, broadcasting final moments and manipulating perception — technology used as a tool of psychological torment.
- Night vision / green glow
  - The night-vision aesthetic (otherworldly green) reframes reality and contributes to disorientation; a motif for altered perception.
- Institutional denial and bureaucratic closure
  - Official reports, medicalization, and threats of psychiatric detention indicate a system that suppresses anomalous truths to maintain order.
- Recurring geography and shifting spaces
  - Villages, alleys, and streets that shift or appear/disappear mirror the narrator’s unstable memory and the creature’s manipulation of space.
- Repetition / echo
  - Voices that loop, repeated radio transmissions, the recurrence of missing-patrol patterns elsewhere — the story implies a pattern beyond one isolated incident.

Additional notable elements / narrative tensions
- The transcript contains inconsistent place names (Kalar / Cholar / Kellar), which functions as a textual motif reinforcing unreliable memory, bureaucratic smoothing, or the narrator’s fading certainty.
- Dual antagonists: a literal, possibly supernatural predator and the institutional disbelief that erases the men’s true fate.
- The ending closes on action (Bowen’s decision to document and hide the truth) rather than resolution, preserving the story’s lingering dread and unresolved quest for answers.
